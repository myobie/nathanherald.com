Seen on [mastodon (@patak@webtoo.ls)](https://m.webtoo.ls/@patak/111484207679580940), I am excited to see that this old trick is being standardized:

```js
let resolve, reject
const promise = new Promise((res, rej) => {
  ;[resolve, reject] = [res, rej]
})
```

Iâ€™ve been using [denoâ€™s standard libraryâ€™s deferred](https://deno.land/std@0.189.0/async/deferred.ts?source=) for a while, and Iâ€™ll be happy to swift to `Promise.withResolvers()` soon ðŸ’ª
