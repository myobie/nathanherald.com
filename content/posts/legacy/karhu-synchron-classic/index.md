[Karhu](http://karhu.com/) is a Finnish sneaker brand I wasn’t familiar with until recently. I’m getting more and more into sneakers and building up a collection. The latest cop for me are from the [Linnut Pack — Part 2](http://karhu.com/linnutpack-p2/) for which the colorways are inspired by bird watching. Yep.

The history of the company is super interesting. You can read a full run-down over at [Sneakers Magazine](http://sneakers-magazine.com/history-check-over-100-years-of-karhu/). They started in 1916 and their Olympic athletes were known as the Flying Finns. Another super crazy fact is [they sold the three stripes to Adidas](http://blog.karhu.com/three-stripes-trademark-sold-to-adidas/) for two bottles of whiskey and €1,600!

> According to Karhu, the two brands struck a historic deal that would make athletic trademark history: “Adi met the Karhu directors and invited them over to Germany. The result of the trip was that Karhu sold the [three stripes](http://blog.karhu.com/three-stripes-trademark-sold-to-adidas/) trademark to adidas for a small sum of money, around €1,600 in today’s terms, plus a couple bottles of good whiskey,” said the brand manager, adding: “That’s how the story goes, although we don’t have proof of the whiskey.”

The unique lacing of the Synchron Classics is 🔥 and I’m excited to wear these around Berlin and during my upcoming trips to the States.
