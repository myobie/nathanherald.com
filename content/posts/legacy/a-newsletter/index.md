Soon, I will start sending [a newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/myobie) with interesting stories, analysis, and links to things that I find interesting. I’ll also include some paragraphs and links to what I’ve been up to. There will definitely be content about startups, Berlin, and tech. There will also be a bit about art and entertainment and how they intersect with tech.

I won’t be posting these emails as blog articles: it is meant to be consumed as a newsletter. The frequency will be every two weeks at first: every other Tuesday around 5pm GMT. I’ll be sending out the first issue 1 Aug.

The name of the newsletter is “Tuesday TEA time.” Yeah. _(Tech, entertainment, and art.)_

I am using [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co) to write and send the newsletter. So far, so good. Their support has been super responsive (thanks Martin).

You can subscribe to my newsletter by following the link below to [my Revue profile page](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/myobie).

I look forward to sending you some interesting emails in the near future.
