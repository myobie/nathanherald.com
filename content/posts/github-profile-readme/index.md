I’ve created a [GitHub profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) which is a special repository + file one can create which is then shown at the top of one’s profile page. You can see my new profile README at [github.com/myobie](https://github.com/myobie) and I’ve put a screenshot below.
