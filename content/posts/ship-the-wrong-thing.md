A post I saw on Mastodon reminded me of an important principle for iterating and learning:

I’ve often used this method to find my way forward. If I don’t know how to make something visually nice, I’ll make something ugly and then ask for feedback. **People find it much easier to tell you how to make something better from a certain point** vs. providing feedback on how something theoretically might look. Write bad code. Draw bad pictures. Ship an ugly prototype. Getting the wrong thing out can help guide you to the right thing.

I recommend trying it out. Make something bad, and then ask for help or advice. You might be surprised how quickly you can make progress using this methodology.
