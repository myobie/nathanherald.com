Iâ€™m taking more and more RAW digital photos + scans of film photos and I finally took the time to regularly back them up â€“ **because I was locked out of my Apple account!**

Apple had a problem back on April 26 where some peopleâ€™s accounts got locked, and it affected me. I woke up and saw that my Apple account was locked, and my phone demanded that I reset my password. So I reset it. Then, after a couple minutes, it demanded that I reset my password yet again.

Iâ€™ve seen how these things can go, and getting into a reset loop like that felt like it could end up locking me out of my Apple account entirely. Before: Apple Photos was my only storage + backup of all 800GB of my photos. Now: I need to run to the electronics store and buy a hard drive.

_You can read more about Appleâ€™s issue on [Michael Tsaiâ€™s blog post which has tons of links](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/04/26/janky-apple-id-security/)._

I turned my iPhone and Mac off, I didnâ€™t want them to accidentally do anything while I was out. I had recently got a [Nothing 2a](https://de.nothing.tech/pages/phone-2a) to test my web work on Android, so I grabbed it and put a prepaid SIM into it so I could do stuff out and about with a phone that Iâ€™m not locked out of.

Then I went down to [Saturn](https://www.saturn.de) and picked up a [Samsung T7 Shield](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/consumer-storage/portable-ssd/t7-shield/) drive. Luckily, I had already done a lot of research about which hard drives are reliable, so I knew these were good. There are cheaper drives that have terrible track records (Sandisk, WD, â€¦) and I didnâ€™t want to deal with that on a stressful day where I felt I might lose access to all my photos forever. I grabbed a 4TB drive so I knew Iâ€™d have plenty  of space for a while.

Iâ€™ve also done a lot of research about which backup program to use on my Mac, and so I knew the best is **[Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com)**. I had already learned that if the drive isnâ€™t plugged in, Arq will just silently fail. I use a MacBook Pro so the T7 might not be plugged in every time Arq runs, and Arq can just handle that scenario quietly without bothering me.

Iâ€™ve already checked the box to keep all my originals on my disk and Iâ€™ve got a 2TB disk in the laptop, so all my Apple Photos were already on my Macâ€™s disk when my Apple account got locked. As long as Appleâ€™s iCloud stuff didnâ€™t decide to remove them from my disk because my account was locked and it thought it might be the secure thing to do, then Iâ€™d be alright.

Iâ€™ve also been using Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (the cloud-ish one) some for the past few months, so I chose to backup those onto my local disk as well.

So I got back, booted up the Mac, installed Arq, and chose to backup my Photos and Lightroom libraries to the T7 ðŸ’ª It took a few hoursâ€¦ then I felt a lot better.

I went ahead and reset my password again. By this time Apple seemed to have gotten a handle on whatever was going on, and after this second password reset things stabilized.

Still, I wonâ€™t ever trust iCloud Photos to be the only place where my photos live â€“ I will make sure they are always somewhere else.

And to that end, now I had a physical backup here, but it is best practice to also have an off-site backupâ€¦ so I signed up for [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com). They are one of the cheapest, yet still reliable, places to store stuff online and they only charge for storage â€“ all the bandwidth / transfer is free.

I knew this would take a while, my upload speed at home isnâ€™t great, and Arq handled it really well. It took more than 2 days for everything to initially upload, and now Arq is smart and uploads anything new every night.

So, because of Apple locking my account and scaring me, I now have nightly backups of my photos to a physical drive and a cloud drive:

It is tempting to feel grateful that Apple had this dumb account locking issue, because it spurred me to finally setup backups for my photosâ€¦ but no it was still dumb. It really proved to me: **my iPhone and my Apple account are too important.** If I lose access, then I lose quite a lotâ€¦ which is pretty annoying.

Smart Phones were fun, little, powerful toys for a while. Now they are required for day-to-day life. **I am now motivated to start to *unbundle* stuff from my phone.**
