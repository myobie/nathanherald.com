This “Manifesto for Slow Learning” linked to by [swissmiss](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2023/03/slow-learning.html) is really great. The ten points of the “Bill of Rights” are:

1. Focus on direction, not destination
2. Raise your hand
3. Learn at your own pace
4. Unplug
5. Change your learning path (and mind)
6. Take a break
7. Make mistakes
8. Leave it unfinished
9. Unlearn and forget
10. Slow down
