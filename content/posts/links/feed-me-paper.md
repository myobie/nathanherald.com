This paper about sharing web content is a good read. They created a browser extensions named FeedMe, where:

> the user mediates recommendations not for themselves, but on behalf of someone they know…
> FeedMe’s users act as gatekeepers for someone else…

One of their conclusions really resonated with me:

> Link Sharing Is Burdensome When It Is a Repetitive Firehose

That feels very true for me. It’s a good paper, give it a read.
