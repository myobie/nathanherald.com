> _How do you manage your personal and your work life? Is there a clear separation between the two for you?_
>
> Massimo: Always separate for me. The studio is not far from my house, a nice place where I can go by bike. I remember years ago I had my studio and my home in the same place â€¦ impossible! The simple act of riding my bicycle for four minutes changes my mind into studio mode and when I go home I think about home.
