These painting by Nathan Walsh are stunning. Checkout [his site](https://www.nathanwalsh.net) to see more, and give him [a follow on Instagram @nathan_walsh_artist](https://www.instagram.com/nathan_walsh_artist/). I cannot get over how detailed, meticulous, and hyper-realistic his work is ðŸ¤© Unbelievable.
