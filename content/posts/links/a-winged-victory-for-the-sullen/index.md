I’ve been a huge fan of A Winged Victory For The Sullen since their first album back in 2011. I’ve listened to that [self titled debut album][] so many times, it’s always at the top of any of my favorites or recap playlists on Apple Music 😅 

I also love to listen to anything by Duston O’Halloran (half of the group), especially the [soundtrack to Breathe In][]. That is also an album I’ve listened to way to frequently, and yet never enough.
