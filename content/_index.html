        I and my colleagues are building a new, fun way to privately share
        stuff with the people you care about most called
        <a href="https://shareup.app">Shareup</a>.
        <strong>Sharing should be easy.</strong> We are currently super focused
        on building a proof-of-concept and we are excited to be able to talk
        more about Shareup soon.

        Before, I worked for <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
        I started a small architecture team whose mission was to help
        understand, document, design, build, and improve the code and services
        behind <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before that, I worked for
        <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>
        after they acquired
        <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>. I
        started a team to prototype a new note-taking experience, then I focused
        on other prototyping projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, I worked on
        <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a> and
        I moved to Berlin to work with the team. My focus was on
        improving the synchronization of data between devices and the general
        experience of using the product across multiple devices and
        collaborating with others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Berlin, I worked at Livingsocial in Washington DC. I took care
        of the mobile website for a while, then moved to SF to work on an
        incubation team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before that, I was an educator for web design and development and
        ran an independent consultancy for web stuffs for many years.
