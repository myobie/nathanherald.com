      I&rsquo;m a product designer and developer in Berlin. I also do product
      advising for startups, due diligence for early-stage investments, and help
      entrepreneurs/companies prioritize, focus, and think through their
      product or MVP.

        I work for <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
        Last year I started a small Architecture team whose mission was to help 
        understand, document, design, build, and improve the code behind
        <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
        This year I'm mainly advising and mentoring.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked for
        <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> for a while
        after they acquired
        <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>. I
        started a team to prototype a new note-taking experience, then I focused
        on prototyping projects for the Outlook design team.
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, I worked on
        <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>.
        I moved to Berlin to work with the team there. My focus was on
        improving the synchronization of data between devices and the general
        experience of using the product across multiple devices and 
        collaborating with others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Berlin, I worked at Livingsocial in Washington DC. I took care
        of the mobile website for a while, then moved to SF to work on an
        incubation team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before that, I was an educator for web design and development and
        ran an independent consultancy for web stuffs for many years.
