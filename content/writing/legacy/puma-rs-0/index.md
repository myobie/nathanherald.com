A reboot of the [RS Computer Shoe](https://www.nicekicks.com/puma-rs-computer-shoe-throwback-thursday/) (yes, for real), the [Puma RS-0](https://eu.puma.com/uk/en/rs-0) is a new ‚Äúfuture-retro‚Äù sneaker and I am in love with them. I copped these over the weekend and I‚Äôve really enjoyed the look and the comfort. They are super comfortable all day, but they are a bit heavy so I don‚Äôt think anyone will be running in these.

The shoe is named the RS-0 because the design team wanted to ‚Äúliterally reboot it back to zero.‚Äù You can read a [good interview with Heiko Desens](https://hypebeast.com/2018/4/puma-heiko-desens-interview) from Puma about the shoe over on Hypebeast. They dropped [two other RS-\* shoes](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/puma-rs/) this weekend as well, but I only copped the zeros.

I am super intrigued by the original Computer Shoe.

They also dropped some special edition RS-0‚Äôs here in Berlin last week including [Polaroid, Sega, and Roland collaborations](http://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/puma-drops-rs-0-collection/). The Polaroids are üî•
