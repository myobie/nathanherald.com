I've gotten my third shot and, like the other two, I had a pretty high fever for about 24 hours. For three out of three shots I've had the same side-effects: high fever and arm pain. My expectation is we will get a shot every year and that I will have the same side-effects each time ğŸ˜… I don't mind, it's very much worth it, and it's not hard to just wait when it's expected and extremely likely to subside soon. I'm grateful to have access to free vaccines and to have pretty light side-effects after ğŸ’ª
