Or at least that’s how I feel right now. My personal site here doesn’t get a ton of updates, but I try to keep it alive by posting links to cool stuff I find on the internet from time-to-time.

Well, today, I got a very hateful and angry email from a dude at Gessato, because I posted a link to their website. He said: 

> Hi Scammer, why are you so full of shit of claiming you wrote this piece. Take that link down immediately fucking scumbag.

That’s a tough email for me to receive, because I don’t ever claim to have done anything much at all, much less claim to write some else’s article. I overthink things, and I’ll be thinking about this email for a while. I’m sure he’s a nice guy in real life, but this wasn’t the best email for me to get this morning.

[I took the link down][gh], because I don’t want anyone to be upset because of a dumb link I posted. It’s just a link.

I’ve tried to understand what the problem was: on my site here I have a mixture of things I’ve written along with links to other places on the web that I think are cool. I post links to movie trailers, books, cool objects, [music][], etc. Similar to [daringfireball.net][] or [swiss-miss.com][]. I think I originally found [the very cool Gessato Modular Space link on swissmiss][sm] and ended up re-posting it to my site. 

Is my site confusing? Does he think I’m claiming I made [a Japanese pop album in 1982][music], before I was born? Is it unclear that I am a real person, and I just post links to things I think are cool? 

I guess not everyone knows that “links” means links to other places, so maybe I should go and add “to other places” or “I promise I am not claiming I made this it’s just a link” to every link?

In the moment, I feel more wary of posting any more links at all here. I’m sure I’ll get over it by the end of today. Maybe I should post more often so it’s clear I am a real person…

Super weird email to get tho, for sure… I gotta shake it off and get back to work.
