Often I want to open a new terminal in vim8 and until today I only knew how to open into a split window of some kind. Today I found out about `++curwin` which instructs the terminal to overtake the current window. All the options for opening a new terminal can be found in the [vim help for terminal](https://vimhelp.org/terminal.txt.html).
