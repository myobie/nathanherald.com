The past year I've been traveling an incredible amount and I've had a lot of opportunities to listen to different types of music. Below are my top, go-to albums for traveling. I prefer albums over playlists which also means I preferred the late [rdio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio) ✌️. So before every flight I download a number of complete albums, always including:

### [Warm On A Cold Night](https://music.apple.com/us/album/warm-on-a-cold-night/1111358527) & [Gone Are the Days](https://music.apple.com/us/album/gone-are-the-days/1059751428) by HONNE

OK, these are two albums, but I pretty much always listen to them back-to-back. The smooth beats, strings, and vocals really make any travel situation more bearable for me.

### [Dawn Chorus](https://music.apple.com/us/album/dawn-chorus/1477510386) by Jacques Greene 

It has surprised me how much I like this album and how often I can listen to it. It rolls and moves and that helps make a flight, train ride, or walk go by faster. I think I'm getting into Electronic; specifically house.

### [Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star](https://music.apple.com/us/album/mos-def-talib-kweli-are-black-star/328713) by Black Star

Arguably one of the best rap albums recorded, I often come back to this to hear some quality hip hop. Definition and Respiration will be relevant and catchy forever.

### [Habit](https://music.apple.com/us/album/habit/1466878928) & [Lush](https://music.apple.com/us/album/lush/1355422978) by Snail Mail

Sure, these are again two albums, but I, again, almost always listen to these two in a row. **These are my number one, go-to albums for travel.** It's always a good time to listen to Snail Mail. They've made some albums which *sound like travel* to me.
