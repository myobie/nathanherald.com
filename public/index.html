            I and my colleagues are building a new, fun way to privately share stuff with the
            people you care about most called <a href="https://new.space/">new.space</a>.
            <strong>Sharing should be easy.</strong> new.space is in public beta right now. Try it
            out and let us know what you think üí™

          <p>
            Before, I worked for <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I started a small
            architecture team whose mission was to help understand, document, design, build, and
            improve the code and services behind <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I worked for <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> after they
            acquired <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>. I started a team to
            prototype a new note-taking experience, then I focused on other prototyping projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, I worked on <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>
            and I moved to Berlin to work with the team. My focus was on improving the
            synchronization of data between devices and the general experience of using the product
            across multiple devices and collaborating with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Berlin, I worked at Livingsocial in Washington DC. I took care of the mobile
            website for a while, then moved to SF to work on an incubation team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was an educator for web design and development and ran an independent
            consultancy for web stuffs for many years.
