            An all aluminum body, milled from a single block, and polished for hours. With a
            minimal UI + big screen, people say it‚Äôs the camera for those who love their
            smartphone.

            A couple years ago I wanted to get into photography and get a <em>real camera</em>, so
            I got an old, original T. And I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. Its design was ahead of
            its time.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Aside: <a href="https://used-photo.de">used-photo.de</a> is great. If you are
              looking for a used Leica, check them out. They were very helpful and even helped me
              get both the T body and my first lens, the 23mm Summicron. I couldn‚Äôt recommend them
              enough.</em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <em>Aside 2: I sent the T to Wetzlar to clean and just check over everything. You can
              ship any camera back to Leica and they will do their best. And they were great. They
              replaced the motherboard in the camera, which did fix some problems and made it
              operate faster. And they completely replaced my lens because the electronics didn‚Äôt
              fully pass their tests. My original 23mm lens was ‚ÄúT mount‚Äù as it was initially
              called. This new one is ‚ÄúL mount‚Äù as they call it now. The cost was incredibly low
              for this service. I have been impressed by Leica as a company.</em>

            And now, Sigma have announced the <a href=
            "https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/bf/">BF</a>. And it definitely feels like the
            spiritual successor to the T. The design from Leica was ahead of its time.
          </p>

            <a href="https://www.sigma-global.com/en/cameras/bf/"><img alt="The new Sigma BF"

          </figure>
          <p>
            <em>(Leica made a TL and then a TL2, but the vibe and design was unchanged + I own the
            original so that‚Äôs what I know best. They recently stopped making the TL2, so there
            definitely is a gap in the market for this type of camera now.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The new Sigma BF is both extremely similar in vibe + better in every way. It even uses
            the same L mount! My lenses would work on it, and the new Sigma lenses would work on my
            T.

            I have been thinking for a while that I should get one of the last TL2 bodies so I
            could get the improved auto-focus, focus peeking zebras, and 24MP‚Ä¶ and now I‚Äôm thinking
            I should save up a little longer and end up with a T and a BF on my shelf üí∏
          </p>
          <p>
            My T takes great photos. I mostly do black and white, but any old Leica can take great
            photos of any kind of scene. From detailed architecture, to soft morning light in the
            green forest, to the soft coastal blues, and really anything else.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img alt=
            "Four of my photos, one black and white of a building, one of the morning light in a forest, one of a hotel facade at night, and one of the coast of Portugal"

            width="1200">
          </figure>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve learned the basics of the exposure triangle with it. It taught me photography.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mostly shoot with manual focus and I lock to a specific ISO, so I am adjusting
            aperture and shutter speed with the two wheels on top of the T. <em>(I mostly do this
            because the autofocus is not good on the old T. But I also do it to build up the muscle
            memory to intuit the exposure of different scenes for when in shoot with my antique
            film cameras.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The BF only has one wheel, on the back, <em>but</em> the sigma lenses have an aperture
            ring. So it really has the same two wheels I am used to using.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>(Leica L mount lenses don‚Äôt have an aperture ring, it‚Äôs driven
            electronically.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the Sigma BF is very appealing to me. The upgraded video capabilities would be
            great, keeping the L mount is great, and moving up to a full frame sensor would make a
            difference to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Both lack a view finder.</strong> And a lot of people seem to think they could
            never take photos without one. I can say confidently that using the screen can be a
            great experience. Having the camera out in front like a phone or a compact like the
            Ricoh GR III brings less attention while out on the street. Pulling a camera up to my
            eye can sometimes turn heads when I only meant to observe.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that is one advantage the T (or TL2) has: <strong>an EVF can be affixed to the hot
            shoe.</strong> The BF doesn‚Äôt have a hot shoe, so it‚Äôs screen for life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching/reading the reviews: the BF almost seems like it was made for me. I love my T,
            but I wish it had great autofocus, higher MP, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shooting with a minimal camera like the T is really freeing. The simplicity of the UI
            keeps me from getting distracted or diving into menus or any of that. I set it up how I
            want, then I go out and enjoy shooting. And I would wager the BF will be the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If you‚Äôve never shot with a minimal, stripped down camera like these then I
            recommend you borrow one.</strong> Having almost no buttons forces one to focus on the
            composition. There is nothing available to waste time with üòÖ
          </p>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs excited to see more ‚Äúweird‚Äù cameras come out. So much of what‚Äôs available all look
            and operate the same, with very minute details. Let‚Äôs see how long it takes me to save
            up for a BF.
