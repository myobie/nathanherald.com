              TL;DR: We all know physical security keys are incredibly secure. Passkeys are modeled
              on physical security keys and are both incredibly secure and incredibly easy to use
              to sign in after they are setup. You get issued one just like a physical security
              key: **you prove who you are, then you get a secure key that re-proves and
              re-authorizes you with just a fingerprint or face scan ** or whatever. Finally the
              ‚Äúremember me on this device‚Äù checkbox will actually work.

          <p>
            How many times have you checked that box and it didn‚Äôt work? You cookies are lost or
            something, who knows. Passkeys don‚Äôt rely on cookies, are incredibly secure, so finally
            ‚Äúremember me‚Äù will actually work.

          <p>
            <strong>Making people provide a password over and over is incredibly insecure!</strong>
            We know this, <strong>we have the data,</strong> people will make mistakes. Yes, you.
            You will, statistically, eventually make a mistake with a password.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>And passkeys making re-signing in easier + prevent us from doing anything by
            accident.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You should not be entering in your password over and over, the ‚Äúremember me‚Äù should
            actually work. It‚Äôs way more secure for remember me to work than to ask someone to
            constantly provide a password ‚Äì no possible attempts to phish that password.
          </p>
          <h3 id="what-passkeys-are-not">
            What passkeys are not
          </h3>
          <p>
            You get a passkey <strong>after</strong> you prove who you are. You still need a way to
            initially prove who you are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passkeys are modeled on physical yubikey-like devices. So imagine getting a passkey in
            the mail or being handed one in person.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, I would prove who I am to a company and they would issue me a physical
            yubikey. They‚Äôd write down the serial number of that yubikey and note that I have it.
            Any device with that yubikey plugged in can be assumed that it is definitely me, I
            don‚Äôt have to provide a password, email, or anything. The key both reminds the service
            who I am and proves that I am definitely who I was when I was given the key.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, just like a physical yubikey, if I were to lose it, then I‚Äôd have to re-prove who
            I was to get a new one.
          </p>
          <h3 id="passkeys-are-the-same-as-physical-keys">
            Passkeys are the same as physical keys
          </h3>
          <p>
            You initially do the more difficult proving step, usually clicking a link in an email
            or something like that. And that step hopefully has a two factor component, to make
            sure you really are who you say you are. <strong>You want this step to be
            difficult,</strong> because you shouldn‚Äôt be doing it very often.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>After</strong> you have proven who you are, then you can get a very secure key
            that will on it‚Äôs own <strong>re-prove</strong> and <strong>re-identify</strong> you
            over and over again with just a finger print, face scan, or something similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine it. <em>Finally the ‚Äúremember me on this device‚Äù checkbox will actually
            work.</em>

          <h3 id="are-passkeys-ready-today">
            Are Passkeys ready today?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Passkeys are good today, because:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Passwords are 100% known to be problematic,</strong> we have the data. You
              may think you are not going to fall for a phishing attempt, but anyone can and does.
              Don‚Äôt be so arrogant to imagine that you can‚Äôt. And phishing isn‚Äôt the only problem,
              it‚Äôs a huge deal and no one is immune.
            </li>
            <li>Even if you had to do the more difficult proving step for each of your devices,
            it‚Äôs only one time per device. After that, use biometrics or similar and you are in. No
            cookies, no password to remember or lose, you are good now forever on this device. This
            <strong>is unquestionably easier</strong> for normal and power users. <strong>‚ÄúRemember
            me on this device‚Äù finally works.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Good ecosystems already sync passkeys: apple, google, 1password, etc. If you use
            them, then you only have to sign in the more difficult way one time, period.
            <strong>Then you are good on all your devices in that ecosystem.</strong> If you use
            two ecosystems, then you‚Äôll have to do the difficult sign in two times (one per
            ecosystem), which is fine. (And, they are working on cross-ecosystem passkey sharing,
            so you only have to do the difficult prove who you are step once across all types of
            devices!)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <em>We all know physical security keys are incredibly secure.</em> <strong>Passkeys are
            modeled on physical security keys</strong> and are both <strong>incredibly
            secure</strong> and <strong>incredibly easy</strong> to use after they are setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get issued one just like a physical security key: you prove who you are, then you
            get a secure key that re-proves and re-authorizes you with just a fingerprint or face
            scan or whatever. Any device with that key can be 100% trusted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure, you still have to prove who you are one time in a more difficult way. It‚Äôs one
            time. And I would suggest that it be made even more difficult to prove who you are,
            since you won‚Äôt have to do it very often anymore. It should be pretty difficult to get
            a new passkey.
          </p>
          <p>
            And you don‚Äôt have to worry about losing a passkey: you can just do the more difficult
            ‚Äúprove who you are‚Äù step again and make a new one, just like requesting a new hardware
            key. There will always continue to be ‚Äúaccount recovery‚Äù steps.
          </p>

          <h3 id="some-faqs">
            Some FAQs
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Are passkeys useful as a second factor:</em> I would say no. They are meant to be
              used as the ultimate ‚Äúremember me on this device‚Äù and that isn‚Äôt what we think of as
              a second factor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>What if someone gains access to my email, can‚Äôt they just get a passkey issued to
              them?</em>
              <ul>
                <li>If the service requires both an email link click + a second factor (like a one
                time passcode), then no. The attacker won‚Äôt have the one time passcode (the second
                factor).
                </li>
                <li>If a service really only checks email and then issues a passkey, then yes
                that‚Äôs bad. That service would let anyone pretend to be you if they have access to
                your inbox today. So the service is very insecure and it‚Äôs unrelated to passkeys.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Can I still have a password?</em>
              <ul>
                <li>Yes, a password could be part of the ‚Äúprove who you are in a more difficult
                way‚Äù flow. However, passwords are known to be terrible, people do make mistakes and
                enter them into the wrong places, and so it is a risk to allow someone to get a
                passkey after entering a password. The service really should implement a second
                factor. A password + second factor as the ‚Äúdifficult path to get a passkey‚Äù is
                perfectly fine, and that lets the passkey focus on being the ultimate ‚Äúremember me
                on this device.‚Äù <strong>So take how you sign in today + actually remember me on
                this device that works.</strong>
