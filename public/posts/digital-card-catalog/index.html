          <p>
            Recently, as we work on completing our proof-of-concept version of <a href=
            "https://shareup.app">Shareup</a>, we‚Äôve often been talking about different ways we can
            best help people work together through our software. I‚Äôve never taken the time to write
            down how I think about collaborative software, so in this post I‚Äôll attempt to. These
            concepts are how Adam, Anthony, and I are approaching building our new product and
            drive a lot of our conversations about how it will work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past couple decades, while working on different distributed software and
            systems, I‚Äôve been able to refine my thoughts about how to categorize and talk about
            collaborating through software. Also, I enjoy reading about software history and the
            many HCI research papers one can find about collaboration, like: <a href=
            "https://www.billbuxton.com/3sCompany.pdf">AR video conferencing</a>, <a href=
            "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.589.7276&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">
            Telehealth</a>, and <a href=
            "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10447318.2019.1619259">related topics</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>, from way back
            when, are responsible for so many different technologies: <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>, <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony">‚Äúvideo links‚Äù</a> and <a href=
            "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2688342_Personal_Distributed_Computing_The_Alto_and_Ethernet_Software">
            distributed software</a> (called ‚Äúethernet software‚Äù at the time) to help people work
            with <a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june96/hearst/06hearst.html">‚Äúdigital
            paper.‚Äù</a> This concept of <strong>digital paper</strong> really resonates with me
            most in my experience building software and has impacted how I think about designing a
            space for collaboration.
          </p>
          <h2 id="digital-paper">
            Digital paper
          </h2>
          <p>
            I like to always start thinking about a piece of software or a system as a group of
            people sitting around a table with a sheet of paper and some markers. Everyone can
            clearly see each other, can easily see when someone is writing or drawing, and it‚Äôs not
            possible to make a mark that cannot be seen by everyone else. Also, everything is
            spatially arranged: when I make a mark to the left of yours, you also see that it‚Äôs to
            the left of the mark you previously made.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> (and now
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>), <a href=
            "https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google Docs</a>, and <a href=
            "https://www.craft.do">Craft</a> pages are examples of ‚Äúdigital paper.‚Äù <em>(I also
            sometimes call them ‚Äúdigital whiteboards.‚Äù)</em> They work like a magic, digitally
            replicated piece of paper that everyone can see and write on together. Everything is
            spatially arranged, we can see each other‚Äôs ‚Äúfingers‚Äù (cursors), and all changes are
            immediately visible to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital whiteboards are the easiest collaborative software to talk about because they
            are both extremely immediate and give everyone 100% visibility. I cannot insert a
            circle into a Figma doc that you cannot see. The rules or ‚Äúphysics‚Äù of the software can
            be talked through very quickly and everyone ‚Äúgets it.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently read <a href="https://www.billbuxton.com/3sCompany.pdf">a Microsoft Research
            paper titled <em>‚ÄúThree‚Äôs Company: Understanding Communication Channels in Three-way
            Distributed Collaboration‚Äù</em></a> where each participant could see ‚Äúshadow images‚Äù of
            the other participants arms and hands as they would attempt to work together to
            accomplish a task like moving a block. Everyone also had audio and video feeds from the
            others. It seemed like everyone got it and the ‚Äúadditional arms‚Äù didn‚Äôt seem to bother
            anyone:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Despite the fact that we regularly saw three, and occasionally saw six arm shadows
              (two per person) in the task space, users did not seem to be distracted by this
              additional clutter.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>(I also found the feedback from participants that the video feed was only really
            useful when preparing for a task, but not during it, super interesting.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I also really liked <a href=
            "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.589.7276&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">
            another paper by Bill Buxton titled <em>‚ÄúTelepresence: Integrating Shared Task and
            Person Spaces‚Äù</em></a> which has a great part which says (emphasis mine):
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              ‚Ä¶ the interaction breaks out of being like watching TV, into a direct engagement of
              the participants. <strong>They meet each other, not the system.</strong>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2 id="what-about-email">
            What about email?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Email can also be considered a ‚Äúdigital paper‚Äù product, however its immutability and
            the slow cycle of feedback make it less useful for a lot of tasks. Now, people love
            email. It‚Äôs the most successful distributed technology ever created.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules are understandable: I write something in a place that only I can see, then I
            hit ‚Äúsend‚Äù which will transfer a copy over to another person‚Äôs inbox (where I cannot
            see) for them to read sometime in the future. I can‚Äôt ‚Äúunsend‚Äù an email and I can‚Äôt
            modify an email after it‚Äôs been sent.
          </p>
          <p>
            For tasks which don‚Äôt need immediacy or really resemble letter writing, then email is
            the right choice. Personally, email doesn‚Äôt interest me much as something to work on. I
            wish the email protocols could be updated to allow for easy end-to-end encryption,
            auto-rejection of unknown senders, etc to make it more private and less overwhelming ‚Äì
            but I also really get why it‚Äôs hard to change something so old and so successful.
          </p>
          <h2 id="what-about-chat">
            What about chat?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Chat software can be a little fuzzy to pin down. While it might seem like a Slack
            channel is both fully immediate and fully visible, it turns out there are things one
            can do that are not shared and Slack tries to make this clear by labelling those
            messages ‚ÄúOnly visible to you‚Äù.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img height="148" src="slack-screenshot.png" width="468">
          </figure>
          <p>
            By making it less clear if everything is fully shared, <strong>it adds stress</strong>
            for users who feel uneasy about trying something because ‚Äúwhat if everyone sees me make
            a mistake‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if I send this to the wrong place.‚Äù <em>(The old <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> software also had ways for
            ‚Äúthe system‚Äù to message you that were only visible to you, so this is not a problem
            unique to Slack.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Apple‚Äôs Messages can also be confusing: if I delete a message, then does it
            delete it for the other person? <em>(No, it doesn‚Äôt.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I prefer software that is immediate: I would almost always rather use chat over email.
            But I also prefer software that is visible: I don‚Äôt like to be confused about who can
            see what.
          </p>
          <h2 id="digital-paper-isnt-enough">
            Digital paper isn‚Äôt enough
          </h2>
          <p>
            Digital paper (or a digital whiteboard) is not enough. Arranging everything spatially
            can make it very difficult to find or remember where something was placed. As a canvas
            for a document grows it becomes harder and harder to keep up. Changes can happen over
            in an area one is not currently paying attention to. And searching for a note or
            comment from a month ago is almost impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Both Miro and Figma continue to add features to try to help mitigate some of these
            issues (like <a href=
            "https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040322673-Follow-Along-with-Observation-Mode">
            following a person‚Äôs viewpoint</a>) which is great. Google Docs can have the table of
            contents to the left which can help some as well.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The metaphor I use to talk about solving this issue is a digital card catalog.
          </p>
          <h2 id="digital-card-catalog">
            Digital card catalog
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I design collaborative software, the metaphor I use the most is a digital card
            deck or digital card catalog, depending on the size and scope of the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we each have a <a href="https://deck.of.cards">deck of playing cards</a>, and we
            shuffle them in different ways, we know we still have the same ‚Äúset of cards‚Äù despite
            the orders being different. I might have the ace of diamonds as my first card and you
            might have the queen of hearts, but we are not confused by that in any way. I can
            always search through and find any card you can. Also, if I decide to filter through
            and make a pile of only hearts, we understand that I am not filtering any cards in your
            deck.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a ‚Äúdigital deck of cards‚Äù system: the card is like a little shared document. When
            we draw on the shared ace of clubs, we can all see the updated design immediately. I
            can also choose to put that card away in the deck and start working on another card.
            Then I won‚Äôt see your updates immediately because I‚Äôm on a different piece of digital
            paper. Everything inside the card is shared and everything outside is personal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes we need a shared way to organize lots of cards which is what I call the
            ‚Äúdigital card catalog‚Äù system: not only is the card a shared digital document, the way
            the cards are organized is also shared. This is analogous to the <a href=
            "https://www.infobloom.com/what-is-a-card-catalog.htm">card catalogs found in
            libraries</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Aside: a long time ago I learned from a few designers that if one wants inspiration
            for how to design information or software for people then always look at maps and
            libraries. They are ways to structure and organize lots of information, they are
            designed to be heavily used, and they try to work for a large number of people with as
            little required training as possible. Also, <a href=
            "https://www.library.wisc.edu/gwslibrarian/bibliographies/disrupting-whiteness-in-libraries/">
            be aware that there are systemic biases inside libraries and the libarary science
            field</a> that are important to know about and not replicate.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            While a ‚Äúdeck of cards‚Äù is a nice and easy analogy, almost all types of software that I
            have helped design or helped build have become larger ‚Äúcard catalog‚Äù systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderlist">Wunderlist</a> was one: each task
            was like a little shared document. Any change you make to task is visible to every
            member of the shared list. And the list itself is the ‚Äúcatalog.‚Äù We all see the same
            tasks in the list at all times.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>One contentious argument we had was whether sorting a list alphabetically was a
            ‚Äúshared action‚Äù or not. IMO, using the physical analogy to card catalogs, sorting or
            filtering is not a shared action. However, I lost this argument, and when someone
            sorted a list it actually sorted those tasks for everyone. I still feel this was a
            mistake and wish I could have done a better job making the case for personal-only
            sorting.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            People prefer <a href=
            "https://uxdesign.cc/design-principle-consistency-6b0cf7e7339f">consistent rules</a> or
            ‚Äúphysics.‚Äù When we are crafting the ‚Äúuniverse‚Äù of a software product it‚Äôs important the
            physics and ‚Äúgravity‚Äù are consistent and feel good. The rules of physical card catalog
            systems are already well documented and understood, so one can leverage that to help
            make our digital card catalog systems easier to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            One can also look to libraries for how to ‚Äúannounce updates‚Äù since it is really
            impossible for a human to keep track of all the ‚Äúnew cards‚Äù in a busy catalog. There
            are ‚Äúnew releases‚Äù or ‚Äúlibrarian picks‚Äù which try to help guide a person to relevant
            topics and places. There are many methods to search, filter, and arrange the cards to
            make it easier to find a specific one.
          </p>
          <p>
            One could make ‚Äútopic drawers‚Äù which include only the cards relevant to that topic.
            There is no reason why the same card cannot be present in more than one drawer if it
            were relevant to many topics. A card could helpfully indicate which other topic drawers
            it could be found in. This would make sense and be welcomed by library visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, in physical libraries, there are cards in the catalog which reference books
            over at other libraries: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_catalog">union
            card catalog.</a> Digitally, it‚Äôs possible to have a system to not just work with
            information inside your group or organization, but also with other groups and
            organizations which could be a huge win. üôå
          </p>
          <h2 id="quick-summary">
            Quick summary
          </h2>
          <p>
            So that‚Äôs what I wanted to write about: when I design or build distributed software to
            help people work together, I almost always think about <em>digital paper</em> organized
            in a <em>digital card catalog.</em> I prefer software to be <em>extremely
            immediate</em> and it to be clear <em>what is shared?</em> and what is not.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm curious though, how do you think about collaborative distributed software? How do
            you think through the rules or <em>physics</em> of the system? <a href=
            "mailto:myobie@hey.com">Send me an email</a>, I am very curious to hear what you think.
