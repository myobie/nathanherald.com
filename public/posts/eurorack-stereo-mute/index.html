            I’m just starting to learn about <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack">Eurorack</a> and <a href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer">modular synthesizers</a>, so I
            think I’m definitely missing quite a bit here, but I couldn’t find an existing module
            or an online post for how to push a button to mute two voltages at once…
          </p>
          <p>
            So, and I suppose this is a normal feeling when working with modular, <strong>I had to
            invent my own mute.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m learning about Eurorack using <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack</a>, the
            incredible program which emulates voltage controlled modules in a very nice, visual
            rack. Here is the patch I was working on yesterday (a “patch” just means “I wired
            things up this way”):
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img alt="Screenshot of the entire patch in VCV Rack" height="780" src=
            "https://nathanherald.com/posts/eurorack-stereo-mute/patch@2x_hu7116186660945088593.png"
            width="1200">
          </figure>
          <p>
            I’ve patched <a href=
            "https://www.modulargrid.net/e/mutable-instruments-plaits">Plaits</a> into <a href=
            "https://www.modulargrid.net/e/mutable-instruments-beads">Beads</a>, and I wanted to be
            able to quickly mute the stereo output of Beads with a single click.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a built-in Mutes module, but it only lets me mute one thing at a time. I want
            to mute both the left and right output from Beads at exactly the same time with one
            click. So it’s a no-go.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the short time I’ve been learning about modular I’ve learned that anytime I want to
            control the volume of something I want to reach for a VCA (voltage controlled
            amplifier). So I pulled two VCAs out into the rack and just starred for a bit…
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img alt="Screenshot of two VCAs turned down to 0% wired up to a scope module" height=

            "https://nathanherald.com/posts/eurorack-stereo-mute/two-vcas@2x_hu2420747990855550486.png"
            width="320">
          </figure>
          <p>
            I browsed through all the modules I have in my library in VCV Rack and saw a “Push”
            module, which is just a push button to go from 0V to 10V when pushed, and then back to
            0V when released. <strong>That is close!</strong>
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img alt=
            "Screen recording of pushing the Push button which opens the VCAs while held down" src=
            "push-button@2x.mov" width="331">
          </figure>
          <p>
            What I want is a toggle tho, I don’t want to have to hold the button down. I want to
            toggle between 0V and 10V.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, after just clicking around for quite a while, I accidentally learned that the
            “Hold” button in the Push module will “push and hold” the button, so it’s effectively a
            toggle for on vs. off. 🙌 So I already had all the modules I needed in place.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img alt=
            "Screen recording of pushing the Hold button which toggles the VCAs on and off" src=
            "hold-button@2x.mov" width="331">
          </figure>
          <p>
            It was super fun to have to look at the tools available and reason out how to
            accomplish my goal. I may have chosen a long or difficult path, but I ended up where I
            wanted to be 💪
          </p>
          <p>
            I bet this is why a lot of people get into and enjoy modular and Eurorack… solving
            problems and puzzles which result in sounds and music is super addictive.
