            Doing maintenance on a 6 year old project today that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have the budget‚Äù for a
            <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)">CDN</a> reminded me
            how important one can be. I‚Äôm writing this to remind myself to stick to my guns and
            always make time for the important things: one of which is using <a href=
            "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Cloudfront</a> or <a href=
            "https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> every time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not every site needs to ‚Äúscale‚Äù (whatever that means), but it‚Äôs a complete waste of
            resources to keep answering requests for the same files over and over again. If a
            project is hosted on heroku, then there is <a href=
            "https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-caching">no web server in front of the
            application</a> to intercept requests for files. The application has to answer and
            handle the same requests over and over again. Even if an app is behind a reverse proxy
            like apache or nginx, the proxy is still answering and streaming files when it doesn‚Äôt
            need to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don‚Äôt under estimate just how easy and useful it is to save money by reducing the
            requests per second hitting the application boxes. While your site is keeping up fine
            now, when a spike happens it can deal with more traffic if it only has to serve the
            dynamic bits. If a page has 4 assets, then a 100% increase is page views could mean a
            400% increase in requests per second. A page with lots of logos or icons or whatever
            might have 100s of assets and every page view is multiplied that much. The simple math
            is: don‚Äôt serve assets yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you‚Äôre willing to repoint the primary domain‚Äôs DNS then using Cloudflare is super
            simple. Sign up, then change DNS settings. Sadly, <a href=
            "https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203689034-Does-CloudFlare-provide-me-with-a-CDN-subdomain-or-hostname-">
            Cloudflare does not provide a hostname</a> to use, so letting them proxy the entire
            domain is the only way.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite CDN is Amazon‚Äôs Cloudfront and it‚Äôs amazingly simple to setup. All CDN‚Äôs
            work the same: the <strong>origin</strong> server is the application‚Äôs primary domain.
            Amazon provides a unique hostname to use, just append the original file‚Äôs path. When
            Amazon doesn‚Äôt have a file in it‚Äôs cache it will ask the origin domain for a fresh copy
            at that path. All one has to do is prepend the hostname like:
            <code>https://abcdefg123.cloudfront.net/images/cats.gif</code>. Another great thing is
            Amazon provides SSL for all Cloudfront subdomains, so no mixed content warnings or
            anything like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I just recently set this up for a rails project hosted on heroku by simply making this
            change to <code>config/production.rb</code>:
          </p>
          <pre><code>config.action_controller.asset_host = 
  "https://abcdefg123.cloudfront.net"
</code></pre>
          <p>
            To make things easier for myself I just set it to always use <code>https</code> even if
            the page including the asset is <code>http</code>. It‚Äôs possible to use URLs like
            <code>//abcdefg123.cloudfront.net/images/cats.gif</code> without the protocol which
            tells the browser ‚Äúuse the same protocol as the base document‚Äù kinda sorta. Try it out
            if you haven‚Äôt.
          </p>
          <p>
            For any other type of application or framework it‚Äôs pretty simple to do something like
            this pseudo code:
          </p>
          <pre><code>module.exports = function asset_path(path) {
  if ($application.env === "production") {
    return $application.config.asset_host + path;
  } else {
    return path;
}
</code></pre>
          <p>
            (Yeah, that‚Äôs javascript referencing a global named <code>$application</code>. Sorry.)
            The basic idea is to make sure every time the path is output for an asset that it is
            ‚Äúrendered‚Äù so in production it can use a different host.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Cloudflare takes over the DNS they let any request for a file not currently
            cached to pass through. This means less configuration up front, but it <em>can</em>
            lead to confusion if it‚Äôs a person‚Äôs first time using a CDN. It‚Äôs possible to configure
            Cloudfront to take over the origin domain as well, but it‚Äôs not required with Amazon‚Äôs
            setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            After setting up a CDN and making sure all assets have the correct hostname in the
            URLs, it‚Äôs important to set the correct headers so the CDN knows how long to keep the
            files. <a href=
            "https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/increasing-application-performance-with-http-cache-headers">
            Heroku has a great overview of HTTP caching</a> and you should read it. The simplest
            thing to do is to add a <code>Cache-Control</code> header for every asset requested by
            the CDN backend:
          </p>
          <pre><code>Cache-Control:public, max-age=31536000
</code></pre>
          <p>
            This is precisely what rails does when it serves an asset in production, so I got
            pretty lucky there. All good web frameworks will do the same thing. If you‚Äôre project
            is framework-less or using some new-awesome-hipster-cool-thing-framework then it should
            be simple to add this header when an asset is requested: if it‚Äôs not then provide a
            patch or module or re-consider your choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, <strong>check the server access logs to see the new found
            amazingness!</strong> Offloading traffic can get way more money out of the application
            boxes and might even allow one to scale down. Not enough writing online talks about
            scaling down instead of up.
