            It‚Äôs starting to get cold again. I‚Äôve been through two winters here now and I‚Äôm already
            bracing for the cold that‚Äôs on the way. Where I‚Äôm from it gets colder and snows more,
            but it <em>feels</em> colder here. The sun seems to disappear for a month and that
            makes everything feel frigid.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be nice to have shorter days. I seem to focus more and really be intentional
            about getting out when the sun is out, doing errands during the daylight, and working
            more into the evenings since they are now the longest part of my day. Some of my
            colleagues take vitamin D supplements during the winter, while others really enjoy the
            darkness. I believe I am able to be much more productive in the winter here, since I am
            less inclined to want to go outside or do anything far from home. Maybe startups formed
            in Berlin will have natural cycles of crunch time in the winter, relaxing vacations in
            the summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also drink more coffee in the winter, but that is fine since the coffees here are so
            small. A large coffee here is normally less than a small where I‚Äôm from. And it‚Äôs
            great. Being able to have a shot of caffeine in the middle of the day without filling
            up with ounces and ounces of water is great.
          </p>
          <p>
            When traveling in Italy and France the coffees were even smaller. Italian coffee places
            didn‚Äôt offer espresso to go, instead you just stand and take it like a shot glass then
            go about your business. I really prefer this style of coffee intake: smaller doses,
            better coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            The coffee really is better. Probably having less at a time makes it somewhat seem
            better, but I generally feel that the quality of coffee here is much higher than where
            I am from. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs better than in SF, there are just too many good places
            in SF to choose from. But a random caf√© in the towns and cities we‚Äôve visited in Europe
            is ten times better than a random caf√© in Virginia or the places we stopped at while
            driving through Wyoming. It‚Äôs possible the baseline for acceptable coffee is just
            higher. Everyone seems to have a decent machine and everyone seems to buy decent
            roasted beans.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I have revisited where I‚Äôm from I‚Äôve been amazed by how much warmer it feels even
            though the temperatures are generally colder. I‚Äôm also amazed by the large coffee-like
            drinks that seem to be everywhere. It seems in fashion to have a large caffeinated
            milkshake all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve learned to really appreciate coffee here. Having less at a time makes something
            more special. And I‚Äôve also learned to appreciate the sun, for exactly the same reason.
