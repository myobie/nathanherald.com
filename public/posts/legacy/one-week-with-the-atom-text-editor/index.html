            Every time I sit down to work I like things to be as similar as possible to the last.
            However, I do know that there are new tools, techniques, and ideas out there that would
            pass me by if I didn‚Äôt change things up every now and then. So this past week I‚Äôve been
            using a different text editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            I normally use <a href="https://www.vim.org">vim</a>. Well, I actually use <a href=
            "http://neovim.io">neovim</a>, which is a fork of vim. Well, really vim was a fork of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a> long ago. The complexity of vim is so
            high, it‚Äôs even hard to explain it‚Äôs name, which version I use, etc. Vim is so
            confusing there is a question on Stack Overflow about it that has been viewed over 1.4
            million times: ‚Äú<a href=
            "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-to-exit-the-vim-editor">How to exit
            the Vim editor?</a>‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            There is <a href=
            "https://qz.com/990214/a-million-people-have-visited-this-web-page-explaining-how-to-close-vim-a-notoriously-difficult-text-editing-program/">
            a Quartz article</a> about that question and the history of vim being difficult. It‚Äôs
            over 30 years old, depending on which version you count. I never recommend vim to
            people. You really shouldn‚Äôt use it unless you want to be super unproductive for six
            months while you learn it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, this past week I didn‚Äôt vim. Instead I used <a href=
            "https://atom.io">Atom</a>, which was created by <a href=
            "https://github.com">GitHub</a> and is based on their open source <a href=
            "https://electronjs.org">Electron</a> framework.

            The Good
          </h3>
          <p>
            Atom has been around long enough to have plugins for everything. It is very unlikely
            that there isn‚Äôt a plugin for your favorite language. One can also customize the UI a
            lot: you can see above that I‚Äôve hidden the normal title bar and file drawer and it
            looks really slick.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is an official plugin for editing concurrently with others named <a href=
            "https://teletype.atom.io">Teletype</a>. This was what really intrigued me to download
            and give Atom a spin: <strong>built in collaboration.</strong> It works and I really
            like it. Every other real-time text editing plugin I‚Äôve used has been awful to setup
            and not really worked well for long periods of time. This really seems to be done
            right.
          </p>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs super easy to install plugins and packages. The available color schemes are very
            good as well. The editor defaults are great: it‚Äôs the best default setup I‚Äôve ever seen
            for a text editor. One can download this thing and get working immediately.
          </p>

            The Bad
          </h3>
          <p>
            It can be slow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Electon (which Atom is built on top of) is a version of <a href=
            "https://www.chromium.org">Chromium</a> (the open source browser Chrome is built on)
            and the UI is all web technologies. Something about those super old text editors that
            is hard to beat is <em>when you type it shows up immediately.</em> I‚Äôm not saying Atom
            is too slow for me: I have used it for an entire week and I enjoyed it. However, it
            really is noticeable sometimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also uses a ton of RAM. This doesn‚Äôt matter on my iMac, but on my MacBook this can
            be a problem. Last week I ended up running Slack (also Electron, so also a Chrome),
            Atom (another Electron), Microsoft Teams (also Electron, believe it or not), some
            docker containers, and then Mail and some websites in Safari and I noticed a big
            difference. Sure, just Atom alone isn‚Äôt really a problem. But having a lot of apps that
            each need the more RAM that most programs hurts my sad little laptop.
          </p>

            The Ugly
          </h3>
          <p>
            It just doesn‚Äôt work sometimes. When I try to find a file by typing a few characters,
            Atom will tell me that it is still indexing or that my project contains zero files. A
            restart of the app normally fixes the issue. This was a problem on my super fast iMac
            as well, so it‚Äôs not a performance issue. I took some screenshots.

          <p>
            When I use vim I have <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> feed
            a file list into <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> and it works every
            time and works immediately. There is no caching: it just is able to scan the entire
            project very quickly every time. It‚Äôs easy to get spoiled by things working so fast and
            it‚Äôs really frustrating that Atom doesn‚Äôt work at least similarly fast (and sometimes
            not at all).
          </p>
          <h3 id="so-whats-the-verdictthen">
            So, what‚Äôs the verdict&nbsp;then?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Atom is really great.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Just the statement ‚ÄúI have ripgrep feed a file list into fzf‚Äù is super complex and
            confusing and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like using vim. I deal with configuring stuff like that
            all the time and it does get tiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Atom is a single thing to install and it generally works. It includes collaboration
            features, it has plugins for anything that are easily installed from inside the
            program, and it has the best defaults of any text editor I‚Äôve ever used.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I recommend trying it out.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            What do you think of Atom? How often do you try other editors or tools?
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm going to back to vim. Vim is a problem: once you get into it it‚Äôs hard to ever use
            anything else. I‚Äôm glad I tried Atom and next time I need to collaborate on some code
            with someone I will fire it up immediately.
