            Most software is simply a fancy spreadsheet or database. It could take you less than an
            hour to prototype an idea you have. Take the time and make it, if you can. Could you
            prototype your idea in <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google
            Sheets</a>? <strong>You probably can.</strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              BTW, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii3PDjJCCQ4">Visicalc</a> is probably
              the most important app ever made.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Input some information into a spreadsheet and then use <a href=
            "https://www.sheet2site.com"><strong>sheet2site</strong></a> to make a website from it.
            Most of the apps or websites you or I use every day are basically lists of data that we
            typed in. Maybe you‚Äôve always wanted to make a list of the best places to visit in your
            home city/town: you can do it. You don‚Äôt need to know how to code.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have some javascript skills, then maybe use <a href=
            "https://sheetsu.com"><strong>Sheetsu</strong></a> and now you have an API to build
            from. Are you good with React? Then maybe use <a href=
            "https://www.scrivito.com">Scrivito</a> and build some custom widgets to build a
            fancier website. Or use the awesome <a href="https://www.contentful.com">Contentful</a>
            to collect all your information and build an app from that. Knowing how to code means
            you can get more built in an hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.lonelypage.io">Build a landing page</a> to market your idea. Post
            onto Twitter or Facebook or simply send an iMessage or Whatsapp message to some friends
            about it. You could use <a href="https://www.wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> to collect feedback
            and/or payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com">Indie Hackers</a> is a website full of stories
            of people who‚Äôve created a simple prototype and now have some recurring income from it.
            Maybe take some time to read a few stories of things that worked and some that didn‚Äôt
            work to help get motivated. Yes, reading about things that didn‚Äôt work <em>is
            motivating</em>. Not everything works out and that is OK. It is, in fact, likely. It‚Äôs
            part of the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Replace one TV show or movie and build a prototype instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Some people don‚Äôt have a spare hour.</strong> So, if you do, take an hour of
            your time and build the prototype of the idea they‚Äôve been telling you about for them.
            Input some data into a spreadsheet, generate a website, and send them a URL and see
            what they think. It never hurts to practice building.
          </p>

            <em>What are some tools or tips you have that have helped you try things our or build
            things quicker?</em>
