            <em>This is an exposition of point 2 from</em> <a href=
            "/posts/legacy/be-a-good-programmer/"><em>Be a good programmer</em></a><em>.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my time as a programmer is spent reading and refactoring code. Very seldom am I
            just typing out lines and lines of new code - and even when I am, I usually end up
            refactoring that new code before it‚Äôs shipped out.
          </p>
          <p>
            By definition, you cannot refactor code without some sort of tests. That‚Äôs what
            refactoring is, changing code without changing the end result of it‚Äôs work.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple example you probably think is stupid is CSS. Change some styles, refresh the
            page. The refresh is the test. You, the human, are verifying that you didn‚Äôt change the
            way things look. This even applies to developers refactoring scripts or application
            code, sometimes a human refreshing is how we know we didn‚Äôt change anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>There are some key points to know:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                If a test has always passed, if it never failed in the beginning, then you don‚Äôt
                know if it‚Äôs testing anything
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If a test fails during a refactoring, it was too granular
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Your tests only try out your assumptions of how the system works
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 id="tests-gottafail">
            Tests gotta&nbsp;fail
          </h3>
          <p>
            Writing tests first is good, because you know they will fail, then pass, then you are
            good. I don‚Äôt always do this, but it‚Äôs probably the best idea. TDD as they call it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you write some code, then write a passing test for it, you don‚Äôt know anything from
            the test. Nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example in ruby that I see often is using <code>assert</code> instead of
            <code>assert_equal</code>. Like this:
          </p>
          <pre tabindex="0"><code>assert "foo", some_var 
assert_equal "foo", some_var
</code></pre>
          <p>
            The first assert will always pass because <code>"foo"</code> is truthy.
            <code>some_var</code> is actually being given as the <code>"message"</code> argument,
            which is shown if the assert fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you require a test to fail before it succeeds, this type of mistake wouldn‚Äôt happen.
          </p>
          <h3 id="tests-need-to-bestable">
            Tests need to be&nbsp;stable
          </h3>
          <p>
            Changing one line of code shouldn‚Äôt break a ton of tests. If it does, your tests are
            probably too granular to mean much. Trying to assert every little thing about a system
            is dangerous, because it can lead to only testing small interactions, but never knowing
            if the entire system even works. I‚Äôve seen rails apps with decent coverage and all
            tests passing that raise errors all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to think about the ins and outs of the system, not the actual algorithms going on
            inside.
          </p>
          <h3 id="your-tests-areflawed">
            Your tests are&nbsp;flawed
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yeah, it kinda sucks, but your tests are not adequate. The problem is that you only
            test how you think the system works. It‚Äôs ok though, you can‚Äôt really help it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applications or websites or whatever act in ways that we would never imagine or
            predict. It‚Äôs pretty cool to see someone use a tool you made for things you never
            thought of. It also means you didn‚Äôt write a test for that scenario.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, you don‚Äôt need to test every scenario. But, if users get used to how
            something works, even if it‚Äôs working in a broken way, they will complain and possibly
            dissent when it changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The solution:</strong> have someone else look at it and/or use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most problems we work on <strong>are human problems</strong> anyway, the computer parts
            of things is most times figured out. I mean unless your Facebook and you have a
            bajillion users so you write your own php. Then you are solving problems no one else
            has. Then it‚Äôs whatever. However, more than likely, you are not Facebook.
