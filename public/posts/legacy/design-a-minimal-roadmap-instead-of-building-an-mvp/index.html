            Often when advising a founder or colleague, we end up talking through what an MVP could
            look like. Not everyone agrees on the definition of ‚Äúviable,‚Äù however, and this always
            creates confusion. Lately, I‚Äôve found it useful to take a slightly different view to
            find a path from zero to one customer. I call it a Minimal Product Roadmap.
          </p>
          <p>
            The different stages of a Minimal Product Roadmap should be close to <em>(from the
            potential customer‚Äôs perspective)</em>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>I understand what you want to build.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I can use what you have built on my device. Cool.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I can see <em>exactly</em> how what you have built will help me.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I would pay for what you have built.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I love what you have built. ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <em>The order of 4 and 5 can change depending on the product. People will pay for
            things they don‚Äôt love and people might not pay even tho they love it. Also your
            product might be free. C‚Äôest la vie.</em>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Side-note: I have heard people say ‚ÄúMinimum Lovable Product‚Äù before to emphasize the
              importance of getting to that last step. It sounds hokey, but it makes sense.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Focusing on the core problem and finding a way to prove that <em>your idea</em> is
            <em>the best way</em> to solve that problem is a tough challenge. It‚Äôs even harder if
            you need to build every feature and implement every detail. Instead only build what can
            get you to the stages I listed above. And for <em>only one problem</em> at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laying out small steps means you can get feedback at each step, possibly re-evaluate
            where you are headed, then arrive at a better place in the end. Getting feedback is
            crucial to building any product. Having a small plan of small steps means you will
            start getting feedback much sooner. You might end up building three, four, or more
            versions before arriving at one that is understandable, usable, and lovable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>So many MVPs should be a Google Form that inserts a row into a
            Spreadsheet.</strong> The founders should have a separate tab with charts and graphs
            for their ‚Äúanalytics dashboard.‚Äù Google Docs has an API and you can <a href=
            "https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheets">hit it with javascript</a> to build
            a frontend. Need something fancier? Then use <a href="https://www.wufoo.com">Wufoo</a>.
            Wufoo can even accept payments, provide tracking and analytics, and basically be your
            ‚Äúcustomer database.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure, lots of ideas are bigger than a web form, but they are probably not as big as you
            are thinking right now. It is one of the most difficult initial challenges for a
            founder to stay small, to resist building that extra thing, to instead polish the one
            feature you truly need until it‚Äôs the best it could be. I suffer from this all the time
            too, ‚ÄúI need to do this and this and this before anyone will get it!‚Äù It‚Äôs just not
            true: <em>you don‚Äôt need to do everything.</em> It‚Äôs easy to procrastinate by doing
            some easy work, like designing more and more screens, and avoiding the hard work of
            building a lovable solution to a single hard problem.

            <a href="http://adaptivepath.org">Adaptive Path</a> has talked about the ‚Äúcupcake
            model‚Äù which is a great way to visualize this:

            I love this analogy because a cupcake can be super detailed if one wanted. <strong>A
            cupcake can be something a customer loves and pays for without being
            full-size.</strong> You don‚Äôt need to build the cake, just build the smallest amazing
            bite. A <a href="http://sprinkles.com/locations/washington-dc/georgetown">cupcake place
            in Washington DC</a> I used to frequent sells ‚Äúicing shots.‚Äù <em>Can you build the
            icing shot version of your product?</em> Give your customers a hit of sugar as soon as
            you can. And don‚Äôt waste your time building a large vanilla sponge cake with no icing
            or decoration, that‚Äôs not lovable.
          </p>

            You‚Äôve probably seen a graphic or two showing the progression from a skateboard to a
            bicycle to a car, instead of building a wheel then axle then body, etc. The first time
            I saw it was from Spotify:

            This is also a great way to reorient how you think. Maybe your startup is about ‚Äúmoving
            people from point A to B‚Äù and so you start building a car. However, a skateboard
            fulfills your mission statement, so why build a whole car? Are you about cars or about
            ‚Äúpersonal transportation?‚Äù Maybe your customers want to get some exercise? Maybe your
            customers want to rent the vehicle and not own? Maybe your customers have to provide
            some elbow-grease at first to help you along at first? That‚Äôs fine. <strong>You cannot
            learn what your customers really want until you are in front of them.</strong> A
            Minimal Product Roadmap gets you in front of them faster.

            And, more selfishly, it feels much better to ship an amazing cupcake than a mediocre
            full-size cake. Receiving positive, loving customer emails is a great motivator,
            especially when it‚Äôs early and everything is super uphill. Be encouraged: it‚Äôs possible
            to think small, to build something minimal and lovable, and to have fun doing it. üòÄ
