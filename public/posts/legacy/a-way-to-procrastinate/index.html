        <p>Wasting time is something I fight against all the time. I mean <em>waste</em> in the sense of <em>having zero value</em>. However, I also know that <strong>I cannot be productive every hour of every day.</strong> I‚Äôve tried and it‚Äôs too exhausting.</p>
<p>Instead, I am always doing around four different side-projects, reading a couple books, watching a few lectures, etc. Having multiple things going on doesn‚Äôt mean you lack focus; <strong>focus is being able to prioritize and choose the correct task for right now.</strong></p>
<p><img src="1-1jcC1GaiZe8xkklerk78DA.jpeg" alt="Wasting vs. investing time."></p>
<h3 id="dont-wast-time-investit">Don‚Äôt wast time, invest¬†it.</h3>
<p>Procrastination is about priorities. Is your current task what you really need to be doing? Is your due-date real or just a trick to motivate yourself? What happens if you don‚Äôt finish on time?</p>
<p>I believe we can, and should, invest in ourselves a little everyday if possible. Instead of constantly working, we can learn, read, and rest. Then we can work more effectively when things are pressing and due-dates are real. Sometimes things really do need to get done, and fast, but I believe a lot of people are <em>busy being busy</em> and not because things are truly pressing.</p>
<h4 id="waste">Waste</h4>
<p>My versions of wasting time are: scrolling twitter for more than 5 minutes, clicking on random youtube videos for no reason, reading political news, watching some old show on netflix‚Ä¶</p>
<p>These things almost never bring me happiness, they are never valuable for me, and I know I‚Äôm wasting the time I spend on them. These are the things that consume my time wastefully, yours are almost certain different. I think it pays to know them so you can be more mindful. Being mindful is a super power that will allow you to procrastinate more effectively.</p>
<h4 id="invest">Invest</h4>
<p>Instead I try to: read a book, take a nap, build something useful, learn more about philosophy, science, or culture‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been trying to get into making music, writing more about myself and my work, and reading. I was never a reader growing up and I‚Äôm trying to make up for that time.</p>
<p><img src="1-U6MO7j0RxDjrqSd0Pxo96A.jpeg" alt="An image to represent ‚Äúmaking music.‚Äù Do something recharging regularly instead of work, if you¬†can."></p>
<p>Some days the most important decision I make is to wait, rest, and then do work. Instead of always working during normal business hours, I sometimes take the time earlier in the day to do other things and then focus on work in the evening after letting the problems bake a bit. I might spend that day building a new webapp to solve some niche problem I have, design a new logo or a set of icons for an app I want to build, or watch lectures about databases, design, or the history of hip-hop. I consider all of these eventually valuable.</p>
<h4 id="being-late">Being late</h4>
<p>I try not to let people down. I try not to be late on things. But sometimes I end up in a place where I just cannot work more hours, I can‚Äôt build more things, I cannot create more stuff without reading, sleeping, or somehow recharging. I‚Äôve overworked myself many times in the past and I‚Äôm just not into that anymore. It‚Äôs always made things worse.</p>
<p>Let the stakeholders know what‚Äôs up, let them know you didn‚Äôt plan accordingly, and learn for next time. I‚Äôd rather be honest, realistic, and eventually get better at planning.</p>
<h4 id="it-costs-something">It costs something.</h4>
<p>I‚Äôve found that it costs a whole lot to construct a less stressful environment where I can do those things which recharge me. <em>How can I take time to read a book when I have looming deadlines and I might get fired? When am I going to find the time to hang out with friends, I‚Äôve got all this work to do? I don‚Äôt have time to take a nap, I gotta have this report turned in by midnight.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There is a cost to prioritizing yourself. Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù always costs something. Instead of imaging it‚Äôs always impossible, I recommend working out the realistic costs of these decisions so you can do a cost/benefit analysis for yourself. Don‚Äôt work from incomplete assumptions if you don‚Äôt have to. Sometimes it does cost too much, but make sure you know that.</p>
<h3 id="it-pays-off-atwork">It pays off at¬†work.</h3>
<p><em>(At least for me.)</em></p>
<p>I‚Äôve almost never done something at work for the first time. Instead, I‚Äôve experimented on my own project or built/designed something for myself, then repeated that at work. Even working on the Wunderlist rewrite I ended up just re-typing tons of code that I had typed before, having conversations that I‚Äôd already debated with myself, and mostly just implementing ideas that I‚Äôd previously worked out.</p>
<p>I like making my mistakes early and in a controlled environment when possible. It‚Äôs not always possible: sometimes I gotta do something new right now. Hopefully I‚Äôve invested in myself so I‚Äôm rested, aware of what‚Äôs possible, what‚Äôs easy, and can break the problem down into small enough chunks to attack. When that‚Äôs not the case it takes me far longer to be effective at my job.</p>
<p>Reading regularly has been the best decision I‚Äôve made for myself in years, probably ever. Not just because we absorb information from books differently than other mediums, but also because I‚Äôve got a really good excuse to procrastinate when I need it. It‚Äôs an enjoyable privilege to be able to take time to read through a book. There have been periods in the past when I didn‚Äôt have the time (or the money to make the time) to read and I‚Äôm very grateful that I can currently carve that time out for myself.</p>
<p>Good luck. Do your best. And, if you don‚Äôt already prioritize it, hopefully you can find some time to invest in yourself soon.</p>
