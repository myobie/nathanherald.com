            I‚Äôve written this story many times, but never published it. Today, however, Joshua
            Davis tweeted my exact feelings:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              without piracy, I never would have mastered the tools, that created a career, where I
              could then purchase said tools in the future.

            <em>This is in response to Adobe switching from a one-time fee to pay for their
            software to a monthly fee to rent their software. I‚Äôve been paying monthly for Creative
            Cloud for over a year now, since I upgraded from CS4 to effectively CS6.</em>
          </p>

            We didn‚Äôt have a computer when I was young. The computers at school never offered much
            more than Wordperfect let alone the opportunity to try to tell the computer what to do.
            I would read books from the library about batch files (they only had old dos books) and
            how to do things with computers, but I didn‚Äôt know what they meant and I didn‚Äôt have a
            way to try them out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then my older brother got a job and bought a computer. I was told not to use it, but I
            did anyway when he was away. He had downloaded lots of different applications and
            seldom used any of them, but I found one that I spent hours and hours using: Flash 3.
            You see, Flash 3 had the ability to create ‚Äúscripts‚Äù by clicking a + icon and choosing
            a command or statement. It wasn‚Äôt altogether very different than writing a BASIC
            program, which I had learned from using a cheap vtech toy as a child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Flash 4 came out and you could do ActionScript. I used to visit praystation,
            flight404, once upon a forest, and other sites every day to see what they were doing
            and what I could learn. I couldn‚Äôt afford books, but I would read every website I could
            find. I spent time on the alt.marcomedia.flash newsgroup asking and answering
            questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never paid for Flash 4. I never paid for 5 either and by the time I had saved up the
            money to buy the softare legally MX 2004 had been released and I was in college.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flash moved me on to Javascript (which it perverted later with ActionScript 3) and html
            and css and on and on. While Flash has a terribly steep learning curve, being able to
            program things on the canvas where you can see it all happen and share that instantly
            with people was exciting.
          </p>
          <p>
            New software like <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> ($24.99)
            and <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> ($29.99) are making it much
            cheaper for beginning designers to get going, but when you have no money even these
            applications are out of reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily working with html, css, and javascript is all text and editing text will always
            be possible with free software. I actually use a program called <a href=
            "http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> that I would never recommend to anyone because of how
            hard it is to use, but it <em>is</em> free.
          </p>
          <p>
            With libraries like <a href="http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/">two.js</a> and <a href=
            "http://www.hypeframework.org/">HYPE</a> one can get started learning and creating
            interactive graphics for free. While there are free tools and libraries, the
            documentation and learning materials are still lacking for beginners. Having to know
            how to program just to get something to move is terrible. Flash gave back as much as
            you put into it, which is why so many designers twisted it‚Äôs sad, crapptastic features
            into beautiful things.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current, best backend development tools and frameworks are free: ruby, python,
            rails, django, postgres, redis, memcached, etc. To become a web developer is a much
            different path: you only need a computer where you can run a free operating system
            which comes with free software with which you can program to do stuff for free. All you
            have to pay for is hosting - and with heroku and others there are free options for that
            as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm not sure if design can or should be dominated by free tools, but I do know that if
            it weren‚Äôt for <em>stolen</em> tools I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today. I was allowed time
            to master tools I couldn‚Äôt afford so I could then make the money to not only buy those
            tools, but support typeface and icon designers and indie software developers and so on‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p>
            I understand that hammers and nails costs money too, but I can borrow a hammer from a
            friend while I learn how to use it.
