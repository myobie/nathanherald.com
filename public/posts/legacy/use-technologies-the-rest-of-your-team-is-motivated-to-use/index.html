            Most of my time is spent either reading or editing someone else‚Äôs work. Very seldom
            does one get to start from scratch when building something for the web ‚Äì and even then
            we use frameworks and libraries we didn‚Äôt write. It‚Äôs very important that the code you
            choose to include in your projects is compatible with your colleague‚Äôs interests and
            motivations.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may want to write a new app in go, but no one else does. Then don‚Äôt do it. Write a
            personal app in go or write the app in go, but don‚Äôt show them and rewrite it in
            whatever. <strong>It‚Äôs important to leave a legacy of making things easier.</strong>
            Someone in the future will curse your name during a git blame if you‚Äôre not careful. It
            might even be you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the developers I work with use ruby, rails, mysql or postgres, redis,
            memcached, git, etc all the time. Now, I‚Äôm pretty fortunate, because those are all
            awesome things to use. However, I learned this lesson more than once working at
            Livingsocial: <strong>don‚Äôt go against the grain unless it‚Äôs worth the
            friction.</strong> (It might be worth it, but make for certain.)
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was planning out a new set of apis for their iOS app I had planned to use
            sinatra and redis. At the time, no team had needed a large redis install, so there
            wasn‚Äôt a primary+secondary pair readily available. <em>The ops guy told me no.</em> He
            said we hire rails people and we use mysql. I was pretty miffed at the time, I felt
            like I was being kept from doing my best work by being limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sinatra and rails are both ruby, how different could they be? How hard could it be to
            install and maintain an HA redis setup?
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out the answers are: <em>quite different</em> and <em>very hard</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When building a core service or library that will be used and modified by any number of
            people, it‚Äôs usually best to be a little boring about it. Sure, go ahead and prototype
            something in closure. But when it comes time to run something in production that serves
            millions of users, <strong>boring trumps clever almost every time.</strong> When you
            are away and no one else even knows how to run the tests in the app ‚Äì well, that‚Äôs when
            they curse your name.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm not advocating that we never push things forward or try out new things. Instead,
            rally the troops and get everyone involved. If everyone on the team is excited to learn
            something new, then it won‚Äôt matter if you are there or not ‚Äì anyone can jump in and
            take care of business. You will learn something new way faster if your colleagues are
            learning it too. They will discover things you didn‚Äôt, you can argue about best
            practices, and bounce things around so they end up the best they can be.
