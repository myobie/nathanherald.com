            Last weekend was Unification Weekend which means we‚Äôve officially been in Deutschland
            for two years. We arrived two years ago to a holiday weekend we were not prepared for.
            Everything was closed, we couldn‚Äôt get food for us or the dog, and we definitely
            couldn‚Äôt get any cables or converters for any electronics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holidays are something I love about Berlin and Europe: people take them. Over the last
            two years, it appears more and more businesses are attempting to stay open, especially
            caf√©s. However, it seems one will never be able to do much else but drink coffee or
            beer on a holiday. I‚Äôm fine with this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except for Christmas. There are many Weihnachtsm√§rkte open. And all the national
            museums are open. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs normal for families to celebrate together at home
            Christmas Eve and then spend Christmas day out and about. We used to do the same at my
            maternal Grandmother‚Äôs. My Great Grandmother‚Äôs last name was Amburgy, but that is the
            American version possibly of Amburger.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last two years we have gotten each other annual passes to the national museums
            on 25 Dec. They cost as much as visiting 5 or so museums a year, plus we get to go to
            one on Christmas. Flying back to the USA during the ‚Äúholiday season‚Äù is way too
            expensive, so it‚Äôs better to wait, remain in Berlin, and visit some museums.
