            Building large systems to process web requests, work jobs, and do other things can be
            daunting without a plan of attack or a system-of-thought. How many components to build,
            how to separate responsibilities, and when to build small or big are questions that
            come up over and over again. Having a framework to answer questions is a huge help and
            keeps things consistent, especially when working on a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way I‚Äôve found to describe my system-of-thought for building large systems is
            object oriented system architecture. This means to loosely apply object oriented
            software design principles to the macro-level of a system‚Äôs architecture. Basically:
            micro-services. The term micro-service is pretty vague now-a-days, so I feel it‚Äôs
            important to be more specific.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next few months I plan to take the time to describe different principles,
            scenarios, and ideas about how to build large systems. The basics are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>An object is a service
            </li>
            <li>Build small, well-defined objects
            </li>
            <li>Objects collaborate by passing messages
            </li>
            <li>Model different problem domains for the system as discrete objects
            </li>
            <li>Expose well-defined attributes and methods
            </li>
            <li>Document and distinguish query and command methods
            </li>
            <li>Objects own their data, which includes their data-store
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A simple example would be a to-do list (I know, I know). There would need to be a lists
            service and a tasks service at a minimum. The lists service cannot talk to the tasks
            data-store, instead it must query the tasks service by passing a message to a query
            method. Things can be broken down even further by separating task reads, task writes,
            and tasks storage. It is not unthinkable to have a TasksGet, TasksSave, and
            TasksRepository object in a class based programming language, therefore it‚Äôs not
            unthinkable to have a tasks-get, tasks-save, and tasks-repository service as part of
            the system architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I built a service like this then the tasks service would expose an HTTP JSON api for
            all queries and commands. I would also have an asynchronous queue to facilitate cleanup
            work, cascade deletes, etc. The tasks service might message itself to cascade a change
            from one set of tasks to another by enqueuing a message onto a queue for a worker to
            later pickup.
          </p>
          <p>
            By thinking on the macro-level about objects, one is free to think about the
            micro-level more simply. Most small, well-defined services don‚Äôt need large software
            object hierarchies. Each query and command could be defined as a single function,
            possibly in a very functional language, as long as it‚Äôs exposed in a well defined way
            to the rest of the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inheritance is even possible by delegating calls from one service to another. A
            completed-tasks-get service might proxy every message to the tasks-get service, then
            filter out all non-completed tasks before returning results. Deciding if completed
            tasks are another service or a method on an existing service is similar to deciding if
            one should add a method to a class or object or to write a simple delegate object
            wrapper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Code is supposed to express the intent of the program and this is more easily achieved
            if the service has one clearly defined purpose. A service might need sophisticated
            permissions rules so one might choose a language better at expressing lists of rules or
            logic programming. Some services might just read and return data with minimal
            transformation and be represented as a simple function conceptually as well as in code.
