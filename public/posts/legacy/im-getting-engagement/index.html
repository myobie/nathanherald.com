            I‚Äôm not sure how, but my tweet got retweeted beyond my normal network of people and I
            am getting a lot of responses. The <a href=
            "https://twitter.com/i/moments/796417517157830656">moment I tweeted</a> has been
            tweeted by others I know, so I wonder if the same thing happened to them. I expected my
            network to be small and homogenous, so I am surprised by the reach this tweet has
            gotten. People really have an emotional response to reading through that moment and
            want to spread it or weigh in.

            The way Twitter‚Äôs UI works for responding or retweeting is confusing and I think this
            is why people are responding to me so often. There also seem to be many conversations
            between lots of other people and I get notified of every response. I normally don‚Äôt get
            to see this side of Twitter since I don‚Äôt have a ton of followers. The total
            impressions for my tweet are 34,805. I‚Äôm not sure how that compares to others but my
            next largest number of impressions I can find is around 800. Somehow that adds up to
            &gt;40,000 I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve only blocked maybe 20 people because of racist or violent responses, so I think
            that is pretty low percentage to what I‚Äôve heard from friends with more followers. I
            also had to block some people because I just kept getting more and more responses from
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Twitter is able to cause a flood of responses from all sides. I haven‚Äôt received much
            abuse, but I have friends who have. I‚Äôm very privileged because if this were my normal
            twitter experience, then I would leave. Others stick it out to connect with others,
            even through the torrents of responses like I‚Äôm temporarily seeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Posting a link isn‚Äôt an endorsement or to shame, but people project onto it what they
            want. Some people assumed I was sympathetic to the victims of the hate speech while
            some others assumed I was sharing that link to gloat about how awesome it is to not
            need to be politically correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any software that connects people needs to have tools and protections in place for it‚Äôs
            users. Twitter is failing. It allows people to swarm others with any content they
            choose and rarely finds that content to be against it‚Äôs terms of service. If you build
            software (I do) then you need to think about your most vulnerable users and plan how
            you will enable and empower them to have a positive experience. Don‚Äôt be lazy, there
            are real consequences if you are.
