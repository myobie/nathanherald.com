        <p>Or at least that’s how I feel right now. My personal site here doesn’t get a ton of updates, but I try to keep it alive by posting links to cool stuff I find on the internet from time-to-time.</p>
<p>Well, today, I got a very hateful and angry email from a dude, because I posted a link to their website. I’m sure he’s a nice guy in real life, but this wasn’t the best email for me to get this morning.</p>
<p>You can read about it on the page for the link post he is so angry about: <a href="/posts/links/modular-office-unit">Modular Office Unit</a>.</p>
<p><del><a href="https://github.com/myobie/nathanherald.com/commit/e2ed2d216f663d895c4967beb05859b1958b58fa">I took the link down</a>, because I don’t want anyone to be upset because of a dumb link I posted. It’s just a link.</del></p>
<p>The email really shocked me, and so I took the link down because I had some other stuff I needed to get to. But after taking some time to think about it, I decided to put the link back, add a big disclaimer, and just describe what happened. You can <a href="/posts/links/modular-office-unit">read the post</a> and determine for yourself if I am claiming to either build furniture or write long-form prose about furniture on some other domain…</p>
<p>Is my site confusing? Does he think I’m claiming I made <a href="https://nathanherald.com/writing/links/takako-mamiya-love-trip/">a Japanese pop album in 1982</a>, before I was born? Is it unclear that I am a real person, and I just post links to things I think are cool?</p>
<p>I guess not everyone knows that “links” means links to other places, other things that are not related to me, so maybe I should go and add “to other places” or “I promise I am not claiming I made this, it’s just a link” to every link?</p>
<p>In the moment, I feel more wary of posting any more links at all here. I’m sure I’ll get over it by the end of today. Maybe I should post more often so it’s clear I am a real person…</p>
<p>Super weird email to get tho, for sure… I gotta shake it off and get back to work.</p>
<p><em>Update: I made some small changes to my site to make super extra clear that links to sites that are not “my name dot com” are to things that I don’t own or have anything to do with. I thought that was obvious before, and now hopefully it’s super obvious. Sheesh.</em></p>
