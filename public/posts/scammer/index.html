            Or at least that‚Äôs how I feel right now. My personal site here doesn‚Äôt get a ton of
            updates, but I try to keep it alive by posting links to cool stuff I find on the
            internet from time-to-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, today, I got a very hateful and angry email from a dude, because I posted a link
            to their website. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a nice guy in real life, but this wasn‚Äôt the best email
            for me to get this morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can read about it on the page for the link post he is so angry about: <a href=
            "/posts/links/modular-office-unit">Modular Office Unit</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <del><a href=
            "https://github.com/myobie/nathanherald.com/commit/e2ed2d216f663d895c4967beb05859b1958b58fa">
            I took the link down</a>, because I don‚Äôt want anyone to be upset because of a dumb
            link I posted. It‚Äôs just a link.</del>
          </p>
          <p>
            The email really shocked me, and so I took the link down because I had some other stuff
            I needed to get to. But after taking some time to think about it, I decided to put the
            link back, add a big disclaimer, and just describe what happened. You can <a href=
            "/posts/links/modular-office-unit">read the post</a> and determine for yourself if I am
            claiming to either build furniture or write long-form prose about furniture on some
            other domain‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p>
            Is my site confusing? Does he think I‚Äôm claiming I made <a href=
            "https://nathanherald.com/writing/links/takako-mamiya-love-trip/">a Japanese pop album
            in 1982</a>, before I was born? Is it unclear that I am a real person, and I just post
            links to things I think are cool?
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess not everyone knows that ‚Äúlinks‚Äù means links to other places, other things that
            are not related to me, so maybe I should go and add ‚Äúto other places‚Äù or ‚ÄúI promise I
            am not claiming I made this, it‚Äôs just a link‚Äù to every link?
          </p>
          <p>
            In the moment, I feel more wary of posting any more links at all here. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll
            get over it by the end of today. Maybe I should post more often so it‚Äôs clear I am a
            real person‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p>
            Super weird email to get tho, for sure‚Ä¶ I gotta shake it off and get back to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Update: I made some small changes to my site to make super extra clear that links
            to sites that are not ‚Äúmy name dot com‚Äù are to things that I don‚Äôt own or have anything
            to do with. I thought that was obvious before, and now hopefully it‚Äôs super obvious.
            Sheesh.</em>
