            I used to run this site on <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a>. Standard static site
            generator setup: write markdown, run <code>hugo build</code>, preview locally, deploy.
            It worked fine, until it didn’t. A hugo update would break publishing new posts and I
            would let my site sit broken for months. Or trying to get the HTML how I wanted would
            require me to learn about shortcodes or weird go template language stuff…
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I deleted all of that.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Now my website is just HTML files. No CMS at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I want to publish a post, I write a markdown or HTML file and then tell
            <code>claude</code>: “publish it.” That’s it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Claude Code has built up its own scripts to convert the markdown to HTML, update the
            RSS feed, add the post to the homepage and archive, run all the formatting tools, and
            handle everything else. I don’t touch any of it. I’ve never even looked at those
            scripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>This is an experiment for me: how far can I push a coding agent?</strong> Can
            we eliminate traditional tooling entirely? Can the robot just do everything “by hand”?
          </p>
          <p>
            Static site generators exist because manually maintaining a website, keeping an RSS
            feed in sync, updating navigation, managing archives, etc, is tedious and error-prone.
          </p>
          <p>
            But <strong>what if the automation doesn’t need to be baked into tooling?</strong> What
            if it can just be… done, on demand, by an agent? What if we can conjure specific,
            tailored tools when we need them?
          </p>
          <p>
            No build step. No framework. No abstractions. Just files.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still write the posts. I wrote this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>claude</code> does everything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the same pattern as <a href="/posts/libraries-have-staff">the library staff
            metaphor I wrote about recently</a>. I’m the user of the library. Claude Code is the
            staff keeping everything organized and accessible for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t realize the anxiety of just dealing with hugo was keeping me from posting.
            Now, I don’t have an excuse. It’s way too easy to throw some markdown over to the thing
            and let it figure it out.
          </p>

            <strong>Agents can replace more infrastructure than I expected.</strong> I thought I’d
            still need some sort of framework or some kind of build system. Turns out those can be
            coded up on-demand. And if I change my mind, new tools are produced and run
            just-in-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Simple systems are easier to maintain.</strong> The less abstraction, the more
            directly Claude Code can work. Bash scripts and HTML files are transparent. Claude can
            read them, understand them, modify them. No nested packages or dependencies. No magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The agent maintains its own tools.</strong> It built the publishing scripts,
            and now it maintains them. When requirements change, It updates the code. What a weird
            future we have created.

            <strong>Local, private coding agent.</strong> I don’t like sending up tons of data to
            Anthropic just to publish a blog post. Can I make this work with a local model on my
            laptop? I’m testing that out when I get time…

            <em>Now, my website is simple.</em> A handful of posts, static pages, an RSS feed. No
            complex taxonomy, no search, no comments, no dynamic features.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I needed those things, I might need real tooling again. Or I might not. Maybe a
            coding agent can just build that stuff too. I honestly don’t know where the line is
            yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe we just need markdown files and a really good agent.
