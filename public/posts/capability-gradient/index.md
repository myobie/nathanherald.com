# The Capability Gradient

I've been thinking about how I feel great when I dive deep into a topic, to expand my knowledge and capabilities in an area, and I think I finally can explain my thought model in a simple framework. I call it the _Capability Gradient_ and it has four levels:

1. **Consume**
2. **Curate**
3. **Collaborate**
4. **Create**

If I need a new chair, I might just go to IKEA. Simple and done. _Or_, I can go further. I can shop around, I can do research, I can learn about the history of chairs, I can develop my taste, and then I can make a more informed decision. _Or_, I can go further still. I can contact a carpenter and collaborate, my taste can be instilled into the design. _Or_, I can go further, I can become an apprentice, practice, and then finally build my own chair.

As a basic consumer, I can only have what is offered in my nearby stores. Developing taste through curation: I can advise my friends and my future self on options. Through collaboration I can customize. And through mastery I have complete freedom to iterate.

The deeper you go, the more adaptable you become. And you’re building capability for *your own future ideas* – the ones you haven’t had yet. You can’t know which current ideas will work or what better ideas you’ll have next month. If you’ve only bought from IKEA, you’re locked in. If you’ve built chairs yourself, you can pivot when inspiration strikes.

Research on [flow states][1] shows people experience [the most satisfaction][2] when deeply engaged in challenging work that matches their skill level – not mindlessly repeating tasks. The assembly line worker who just repeats motions gets bored. The one who pushes deeper, builds mastery. [They find flow.][3] Going deep isn’t just strategic – it can be more satisfying. 

**However, not everyone wants to climb to “create” on every gradient.** Some people thrive on variety and get bored going deep. [Others love mastery.][4] The key is knowing where you’re most comfortable and being intentional about it. **Maybe you’re naturally a curator. That’s great!** The point isn’t that everyone should become a craftsman – it’s that you can choose your depth deliberately, understanding the tradeoffs and understanding yourself. When something really matters to you, when you want maximum adaptability for future ideas, that’s when you can push deeper.

- **Food:** Restaurants → farmers markets → cooking classes → growing your own
- **Software:** Use apps → compare tools → customize workflows → build your own
- **Content:** Consume → curate/share → remix → create original
- Etc

This isn’t about doing everything yourself or becoming a jack-of-all-trades. It’s about strategically and intentionally choosing where to build capability – where you want the freedom to adapt, iterate, and respond to ideas you haven’t had yet. 

Thinking through this framework has helped me understand where I am most content and happy, and why I behave the way I do sometimes, maybe it can help you as well.
