          <p>
            I've been thinking about how I feel great when I dive deep into a topic, to expand my
            knowledge and capabilities in an area, and I think I finally can explain my thought
            model in a simple framework. I call it the <em>Capability Gradient</em> and it has four
            levels:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <strong>Consume</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Curate</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Collaborate</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Create</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If I need a new chair, I might just go to IKEA. Simple and done. <em>Or</em>, I can go
            further. I can shop around, I can do research, I can learn about the history of chairs,
            I can develop my taste, and then I can make a more informed decision. <em>Or</em>, I
            can go further still. I can contact a carpenter and collaborate, my taste can be
            instilled into the design. <em>Or</em>, I can go further, I can become an apprentice,
            practice, and then finally build my own chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a basic consumer, I can only have what is offered in my nearby stores. Developing
            taste through curation: I can advise my friends and my future self on options. Through
            collaboration I can customize. And through mastery I complete freedom to iterate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deeper you go, the more adaptable you become. And you’re building capability for
            <em>your own future ideas</em> – the ones you haven’t had yet. You can’t know which
            current ideas will work or what better ideas you’ll have next month. If you’ve only
            bought from IKEA, you’re locked in. If you’ve built chairs yourself, you can pivot when
            inspiration strikes.
          </p>

            Research on <a href=
            "https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/science-of-happiness/getting-in-the-flow/">flow
            states</a> shows people experience <a href=
            "https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/">the most satisfaction</a>
            when deeply engaged in challenging work that matches their skill level – not mindlessly
            repeating tasks. The assembly line worker who just repeats motions gets bored. The one
            who pushes deeper, builds mastery. <a href=
            "https://planyway.com/blog/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi-flow-theory">They find flow.</a>
            Going deep isn’t just strategic – it can be more satisfying.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>However, not everyone wants to climb to “create” on every gradient.</strong>
            Some people thrive on variety and get bored going deep. <a href=
            "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260404911_Mastery_in_happiness_-_the_role_of_expertise_in_everyday_life">
            Others love mastery.</a> The key is knowing where you’re most comfortable and being
            intentional about it. <strong>Maybe you’re naturally a curator. That’s great!</strong>
            The point isn’t that everyone should become a craftsman – it’s that you can choose your
            depth deliberately, understanding the tradeoffs and understanding yourself. When
            something really matters to you, when you want maximum adaptability for future ideas,
            that’s when you can push deeper.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Food:</strong> Restaurants → farmers markets → cooking classes → growing your
              own
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Software:</strong> Use apps → compare tools → customize workflows → build
              your own
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content:</strong> Consume → curate/share → remix → create original
            </li>
            <li>Etc
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This isn’t about doing everything yourself or becoming a jack-of-all-trades. It’s about
            strategically and intentionally choosing where to build capability – where you want the
            freedom to adapt, iterate, and respond to ideas you haven’t had yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking through this framework has helped me understand where I am most content and
            happy, and why I behave the way I do sometimes, maybe it can help you as well.
