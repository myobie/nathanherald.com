            I use <a href="https://www.typography.com/webfonts">typography.com’s cloud service</a>
            so I can use the wonderful <a href=
            "https://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/design-notes">Whitney</a> here for my
            personal website 🥰
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with <a href=
            "https://nathanherald.com/writing/links/ana-vidovi%C4%87-classical-guitar/">the last
            post I made</a>, the artist’s name had a character in it which didn’t show up
            correctly: ć. This bothered me quite a bit, so I dug into the “Cloud Dashboard” to see
            what might be the issue, and it turns out the settings (which I assume are the
            defaults) are to not provide every possible character as part of the font package
            –&nbsp;I assume to save some bytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I changed from “Basic Latin Accents” to “Extended Latin Accents” and now the ć shows
            up.

            <p>
              Side note: I am not sure if this “Cloud.typography” service is really being
              maintained. The dashboard UI has never changed, and appears really tiny on any modern
              computer screen. They don’t really link to the service from their navigation at all
              anymore, I had to google the service to find the url to its page. They do link to it
              during checkout, but it makes we wonder if maybe it’s being deemphasized.
            </p>
            <p>
              Either way, this is the only way I can use Whitney here, so it’s worth the trouble I
              guess. 😞 Maybe I should buy the <a href=
              "https://www.typography.com/fonts/digital-type-capsule/overview">Digital Type
              Capsule</a>, download them for offline use as woff files, and use those instead?

            What’s the lesson? Just use the entire font file, don’t try to be cute and slim it
            down. You never know when you might want to use a character which the font supports,
            but with your version doesn’t include.
