        <p>This past weekend I saw a person with a nice Leica rangefinder camera standing outside the shop my partner and I were in, so I asked him about his camera, how long he had been a photographer, etc. I am getting more and more into photography and I love hearing from others about their photography, cameras, etc.</p>
<p>It turned out I met Christian Klopf, a doctor here in Berlin. He said he moved to Berlin in 1986 and has been taking photos here for decades.</p>
<p>Then, on his phone, he showed me an old photo he had taken and I recognized it immediately ‚Äì his photo is printed on this house:</p>

<p>I walk past this photo often. There are many photos setup along the historical path of the wall in my neighborhood and it never occurred to me that <em>the people who took those photos might still live here,</em> might still be taking photos nearby. I mean <em>of course,</em> but also <em>wow.</em></p>

<p>Sometimes taking photos of <em>mundane subjects</em> or everyday activities can seem <em>unimportant.</em> However, it‚Äôs good to be reminded that documenting and capturing the state of the world is always valuable. You never know when a photo might end up being historically important or even a bit famous (famous to me at least üòÜ).</p>
<p>It was great to meet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/christianklopfberlin/">Christian and you can follow him on Instagram</a>, like I do.</p>
<p>I am very inspired to get out there and take more photos. üí™</p>
