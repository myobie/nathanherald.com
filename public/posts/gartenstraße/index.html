            This past weekend I saw a person with a nice Leica rangefinder camera standing outside
            the shop my partner and I were in, so I asked him about his camera, how long he had
            been a photographer, etc. I am getting more and more into photography and I love
            hearing from others about their photography, cameras, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turned out I met Christian Klopf, a doctor here in Berlin. He said he moved to
            Berlin in 1986 and has been taking photos here for decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, on his phone, he showed me an old photo he had taken and I recognized it
            immediately ‚Äì his photo is printed on this house:
          </p>

          <p>
            I walk past this photo often. There are many photos setup along the historical path of
            the wall in my neighborhood and it never occurred to me that <em>the people who took
            those photos might still live here,</em> might still be taking photos nearby. I mean
            <em>of course,</em> but also <em>wow.</em>

            Sometimes taking photos of <em>mundane subjects</em> or everyday activities can seem
            <em>unimportant.</em> However, it‚Äôs good to be reminded that documenting and capturing
            the state of the world is always valuable. You never know when a photo might end up
            being historically important or even a bit famous (famous to me at least üòÜ).

            It was great to meet <a href=
            "https://www.instagram.com/christianklopfberlin/">Christian and you can follow him on
            Instagram</a>, like I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very inspired to get out there and take more photos. üí™
