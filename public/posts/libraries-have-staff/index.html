          <p>
            A few years ago, <a href="https://nathanherald.com/posts/digital-card-catalog/">I wrote
            about how the library’s card catalog is the right metaphor for organizing our digital
            information</a>. The physical catalog works because it connects all our information
            exactly how we need for our personal knowledge bases.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I missed something fundamental: <strong>the card catalog in a real Library doesn’t
            maintain itself.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind every well-organized library is <strong>a team of people</strong> constantly
            working to keep information accessible. They’re cataloging new acquisitions, updating
            subject headings, cross-referencing related materials, culling outdated items, all
            <em>before</em> you ask. When you walk into a library and find exactly what you’re
            looking for, it’s because of the wonderful staff there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason we struggle with digital organization isn’t that we lack filing systems:
            there are too many <em>systems</em> out there to count. It’s that <strong>we’re trying
            to be both the user and the entire staff,</strong> and we simply don’t have the time.
          </p>
          <h2 id="what-library-staff-actually-do">
            What Library Staff Actually Do
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Cataloging</strong>: Every new item gets metadata assigned: and not just title
            and author, but subject headings, classifications, and keywords.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cross-referencing</strong>: Related materials get linked. If you’re checkout
            out the Cold War, the librarian has already connected biographies, primary source
            documents, and relevant periodicals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Collection maintenance</strong>: Old, outdated, or rarely-used items get
            evaluated. The collection stays relevant through <strong>active curation, not just
            accumulation.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Discovery support</strong>: Librarians create displays, reading lists, and
            subject guides that surface relevant materials you didn’t know to ask for.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Answer questions</strong>: When search isn’t cutting it, a human who
            understands the collection and knows where things are can help.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this is <strong>proactive</strong>. The organization work happens continuously
            in the background, an act of renewal.
          </p>
          <h2 id="weve-been-trying-to-do-this-ourselves">
            We’ve Been Trying to Do This Ourselves
          </h2>
          <p>
            With all of our notes, documents, bookmarks, photos, and emails, we are attempting to
            be our own librarians. We make folders. We add tags when we remember. We try to search
            when we need something. We promise ourselves we’ll organize everything soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t work because the ratio is impossible: one person cannot be both a library’s
            sole user and its entire staff. The cataloging work scales with the collection size and
            our available time does not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every productivity system eventually fails for this reason. We build the perfect folder
            hierarchy, create the ultimate tagging system, install the best knowledge management
            software; then life happens. Files pile up. Tags become inconsistent. The system that
            was supposed to save us time becomes another thing we feel guilty about not
            maintaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem isn’t our discipline – the problem is structural.

            A Personal Library Staff?
          </h2>
          <p>
            For the first time, we can actually build something resembling “a proactive staff.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloud AI <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/">agents</a> can do some
            of this work, but at the expense of sending all our private information up to their
            servers constantly…
          </p>
          <p>
            So recently <strong>I’ve been learning about and working with local models,</strong>
            the ones you can run on your phone or laptop in a truly private, offline way. I’ve had
            success doing the systematic, repetitive organization work that can improve our
            personal knowledge systems and finally make them workable over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s what I’ve learned is possible: I can build agents that process new documents as
            they arrive, extracting metadata and assigning categories based on my existing system.
            When patterns emerge, they suggest new categories I hadn’t thought of. I’ve programmed
            experiments to scan my collection for connections – linking meeting notes to project
            documents, research papers to relevant bookmarks, photos to calendar events.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can handle maintenance too. Flagging duplicates, identifying outdated information,
            highlighting orphaned items that have no connections to anything else. As documents
            move into my archive, agents generate abstracts so I don’t lose track of what I once
            knew. They create reading lists organized by theme, produce regular digests of what
            I’ve saved recently.
          </p>
          <p>
            And they can “learn” from how I search. Every query I run is information about what
            matters to me and how I think about my personal context. An agent can use that to
            preemptively improve discoverability of materials I’ll likely need, without me having
            to stop and manually organize everything first.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of this requires me to stop what I’m doing to organize. The agents can work in the
            background.
          </p>
          <h2 id="private-and-local-is-the-future">
            Private and local is the future
          </h2>
          <p>
            Your personal context contains your most sensitive information: work documents,
            personal notes, financial records, health information, etc. Sending this to a cloud AI
            service doesn’t feel right. And we don’t have to.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Mac Mini can run models that will handle this work. No subscriptions. No data leaving
            your network. Your local private “staff” works for you, not for the cloud provider that
            trained them.
          </p>
          <h3 id="specialized-agents-not-one-super-agent">
            Specialized agents, not one super-agent
          </h3>
          <p>
            Local models are small, so it is prudent to build many small agents instead of one big
            one.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>filing agent</strong> that runs daily to categorize new items
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>connection agent</strong> that finds relationships between materials
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>maintenance agent</strong> that flags issues and duplicates
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>summary agent</strong> that creates abstracts and digests
            </li>
            <li>A <strong>search agent</strong> that learns from your queries to improve indexing
            </li>
            <li>Etc
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each agent should have focused instructions tailored to your specific organization
            system. You’re not prompting ChatGPT to “organize my files.” You’re running custom,
            tailored local programs that know your taxonomy, your terminology, and your priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time you search for something or ask a question, you’re providing data about what
            matters to you and how you think about your information. Every time you manually
            connect two documents, you’re teaching the system about relationships it should look
            for. Every time you can’t find something, you’re revealing a gap in the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            These patterns should become instructions for proactive work. If you frequently search
            for “client feedback from Q3,” your agents should learn to automatically tag and group
            client feedback by quarter. If you often link legal documents to project files, your
            agents should start suggesting those connections preemptively.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            The library card catalog works because it is maintained by people whose full-time job
            is keeping information accessible. Personal knowledge management has failed for most of
            us because we’re trying to do that work ourselves while also being the library’s
            primary user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local, private agents can solve this by becoming your library staff. They can do the
            proactive, systematic organization work in the background. They can learn from your
            usage patterns. They can run continuously without requiring your attention. And because
            they run locally, your information stays yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don’t need better organizational discipline. You need staff. And for the first
            time, you might can actually have them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m building toward this vision in a product called <a href=
            "https://new.space/app">new.space</a>. Run local models on your iPhone today. Give it a
            try.
