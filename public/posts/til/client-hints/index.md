While reading [this article by Umar about considerate javascript][article] I was surprised to see the `<meta http-equiv="Accept-CH" â€¦>` method for appending request headers for client information! It's called [Client Hints][ietf]. Sadly, it seems [it's Chrome-only][ch] ðŸ˜”.

This also lead me to the [Network Information API spec][net] which would be super useful, but [is also Chrome-only][ni] ðŸ˜”. The amount of Chrome-only APIs is ever growing and seems unstoppable, since all the browser makers rarely agree on priorities.
