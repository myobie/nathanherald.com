Today I was trying to make a screen recording on my Mac of some notifications coming in, but anytime I started recording the screen the notifications would no longer show up. When I stopped recording, there they were üò°

There is a setting in System Settings to ‚ÄúAllow notifications when mirroring or sharing the display‚Äù which is off by default. That makes perfect sense, if you are presenting or sharing your screen you don‚Äôt want people to see your notifications.

So I toggled it to on, was able to do my screen recording of the notifications, and then toggled it back to off.
