            This past weekend I watched <em>The Man from Laramie</em> in the <a href=
            "https://www.criterionchannel.com/anthony-mann-directs-james-stewart">Criterion
            Channel‚Äôs <em>Anthony Mann Directs James Stewart</em></a> collection. This was the
            fifth and final film Mann directed with Stewart as the star, and it was a great watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with all their problems, I still love a good Western. I grew up watching them and
            they still captivate me. Especially one that has something interesting to say ‚Äì and
            that‚Äôs what surprised me the most about this movie: it‚Äôs politics seem pretty
            progressive for 1955.

            <summary>
              Some plot spoilers‚Ä¶
            </summary>
            <p>
              The motivation of Stewart‚Äôs character was to hunt down and kill the person he felt
              responsible for his brother‚Äôs death. His brother was in the Cavalry and his entire
              group had been gunned down by nearby Native Americans.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, he didn‚Äôt blame nor was looking for the Native Americans, he was instead looking
              for who sold the ‚Äúrepeater rifles‚Äù to them. Since, to him, the person who sold the
              arms is just as guilty, or more, as the people who used them. The movie presents this
              as a very plausible and sensible motivation.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is currently being debated back home in the US: can gun manufactures be held
              liable for how their weapons are used? Now manufacture vs. dealer is different, sure,
              but it really seemed so ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù when watching this film.
            </p>
          </details>
          <p>
            <em>Also, this movie appeared to be ‚Äútrying it‚Äôs best‚Äù for 1955 and not fall into every
            trope or harmful portrayal‚Ä¶ but still it‚Äôs a Western from 1955 and does briefly present
            indigenous peoples in disparaging ways.</em>
          </p>

            It has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_from_laramie">100% on the tomato
            meter</a>, and it deserves a high score for sure. Stewart‚Äôs performance was
            captivating, and at times gut wrenching. I recommend giving it a watch. And I plan to
            watch the other four films in <a href=
            "https://www.criterionchannel.com/anthony-mann-directs-james-stewart">the
            collection</a>.
