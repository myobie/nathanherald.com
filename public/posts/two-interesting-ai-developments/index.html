            Two things I saw recently that prompted me to <a href="/ai">update my /ai page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><a href="https://openclaw.ai/">OpenClaw</a></strong> is an open-source,
            self-hosted personal AI agent by Peter Steinberger (steipete, founder of PSPDFKit).
            It’s an AI that doesn’t just chat but actually does things: it can message people via
            WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, control a browser, automate your devices, and has an
            extensible plugin system. It runs on your own hardware. The project has had quite the
            naming saga – it started as Clawdis, became Clawdbot (~30k GitHub stars), got renamed
            to Moltbot after Anthropic’s legal team reached out about the name, and finally landed
            on OpenClaw. It now has 179k+ GitHub stars. It’s a huge project and worth keeping an
            eye on, though it does have all three legs of Simon Willison’s <a href=
            "https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/">lethal trifecta</a>.
          </p>

            <strong><a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey">My AI Adoption
            Journey</a></strong> by Mitchell Hashimoto (co-founder of HashiCorp) documents his
            six-phase path from AI skepticism to running agents continuously. The whole thing is
            worth reading. I’ve had a similar journey, especially the part where he forces himself
            to reproduce his own work with the agent. I took the time to do that too: sit down and
            try to get the coding agent to write the code how I would write it. Now I feel more
            confident being able to instruct the robot to do things and know that the output will
            be pretty reasonable. That confidence doesn’t come from the tools getting better
            (though they are). It comes from me learning what they need to hear.
