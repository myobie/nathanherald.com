          <p>
            In 2013 I was tired of maintaining my own blog and started posting onto <a href=
            "https://medium.com/@myobie">medium.com</a> to save myself time. The first post was
            <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/the-cost-of-education-63e3533b99c3">The Cost of
            Education</a> into a collection named IMHO back when anyone could make and join
            collections. I even became a paid member to help support ‚Äúmy blogging platform‚Äù so I
            wasn‚Äôt betting on a free service. Sadly, during the last couple years Medium has just
            been making things terrible ‚Äì the worst of which is showing div popovers overtop my
            writing requesting readers to signup, sometimes not letting them read my writing if
            they don‚Äôt become paid members.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am no longer a paid member for Medium and I have migrated my writing over to <a href=
            "https://nathanherald.com/posts/">my own website</a>. When medium first launched it was
            a great example of good typography and easy publishing and it‚Äôs sad to see them ruin
            it.

          <p>
            I‚Äôm using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> to build everything statically. I‚Äôm
            using <a href="https://zeit.co/home">now by zeit</a> to build, deploy, and host my
            files. I‚Äôm using <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> to edit my files on both
            <a href="macappstore://itunes.apple.com/app/id775737590?mt=12">macOS</a> and <a href=
            "macappstore://itunes.apple.com/app/id775737172?mt=12">iOS</a> and I push updates to my
            files with <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> on macOS and <a href=
            "https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> on iOS. Working Copy is a ‚Äúfile provider‚Äù
            on iOS which lets one edit the files from the git repo in any app like Writer or
            anything else with access to the Files app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zeit creates a test website for every branch I push, so I can easily push a new post
            from my Mac or phone with a real, live preview and then merge when I‚Äôm happy ‚Äì which is
            a great workflow for me. hugo is so fast that I never wait more than a couple seconds
            for everything to rebuild. I‚Äôm super happy with this setup üòé

            I‚Äôm going to be traveling for a couple weeks without a laptop, so I prepared as much as
            I could to enable me to be able to do full posts entirely from my phone. Here is what
            that looks like:

            Switching costs
          </h3>
          <p>
            It took way longer than I hoped or assumed to migrate away from Medium. The switching
            cost is real and high. I wish it weren‚Äôt the case, but publishing on the internet
            reliably is still not ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            hugo‚Äôs shortcodes are always confusing and having to use them for inserting images
            means I cannot preview images directly in Writer. I may just edit the images in
            <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/ios/">Pixelmator</a> and then use the normal
            markdown image syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zeit makes an assumption that builds are immutable and deterministic. While this is
            true for my website, there is one input that I consider a change that they do not: for
            the preview websites for every PR the domain for the website is not
            <code>nathanherald.com</code> so I use an <code>ENV</code> variable to inject a
            predictable domain for hugo to use. When I merge the PR, Zeit looks at the source code
            and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen all this before, so I‚Äôm not rebuilding again‚Äù and it promotes the
            version of the site built for something other than <code>nathanherald.com</code> and
            that breaks all the images and colors and everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got annoyed and decided I would just move to <a href=
            "https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> and just build <a href=
            "https://gist.github.com/myobie/aafd9885aeea21aed19b85a60cacda4f">wtf I want</a>, but I
            have fallen prey to a bug in Actions that affects me because of my super-early access
            to the feature. It will be probably get fixed by next week‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve created a workaround for the Zeit problem and I‚Äôve sent them an email to ask them
            to consider the change in <code>ENV</code> variables as a ‚Äúchange of inputs‚Äù and
            therefore trigger a new build‚Ä¶

            Good times‚Ñ¢ as usual. I do love building for the web.
