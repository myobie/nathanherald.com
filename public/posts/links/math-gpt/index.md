> Use GPT3 to solve math problems, and get the code behind each solution!

This is pretty cool, it asks [ChatGPT][] to write python code to solve math problems. It is really pretty amazing to see.

I did wonder if it was actually doing the calculation or if it had memorized a lot of calculations, so I did a test that you should not do.

I asked it to find the 67,879,887,654,898th prime number. I feel bad, because it tried to find the prime, and the entire service went down. It was down for about 40 minutes. It did not find the prime.

Iâ€™m not sure how one could protect against [DOS attacks][] when the goal is to have a ML model write a computer program, and then execute it. ðŸ¤” One would have real uptime problems without any protections, but maybe that doesnâ€™t matter if the system can timeout anything and just restart itself.
