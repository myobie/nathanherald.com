I love these arresting images with the playful bubbles floating throughout. This is from their [“Artist’s Statement” page](https://olamideogunade.com/myart):

> My art is an expression of figurative images using charcoal and colors to give it a contemporary look. It talks about situations in African society. The skin is an essential thing. I love to create it by focusing on such details as contrast. The dark hue of the skin is usually accompanied with vibrant colors for that complementary yinyang color contrast. I then sum up the work with bubbles – this captures the temporariness of the pressures we face.
