Anthropic just dropped Remote Control for Claude Code, letting you remote control your computer from your phone. Claude keeps running locally, your phone is just a window into the session.

I drafted this post from my phone using Remote Control and published it from my computer. It's a nice workflow: my Mac keeps working and I can message it from anywhere.
