TIL about IndieKit, which is a small server to allow one to quickly post to a statically generated website (like mine), syndicate posts to other sites like Twitter or Mastodon (like I want to do), and seems pretty customizable. 

I‚Äôve had things setup on my phone for a while where I can write a markdown post using [iA Writer][], committing it using [Working Copy][], and then it gets deployed with [Netlify][]‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs all too much and too brittle. 

I really want a simple box I can type some text into, click ‚Äúpublish,‚Äù and then it appears here on my site. I don‚Äôt post as often as I‚Äôd like because of how difficult it is for me to post from my phone.

I‚Äôm not sure if IndieKit is the answer for me (I really want a solution that uses Cloudflare Workers if possible), but I‚Äôm going to set something like this up soon‚Ä¶ I hope ü§û
