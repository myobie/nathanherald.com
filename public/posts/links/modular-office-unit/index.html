            <strong>Update about this link post:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I originally found a link about this modular office unit thing via <a href=
            "https://www.swiss-miss.com/2022/12/gasp-this-modular-space.html">swiss-miss.com</a>, I
            thought it was super cool, and so I posted the same link here from my site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, a dude at gessato.com sent me a very ugly email, asking me to take this link
            down. It seems he thinks I am taking credit for building the office thing, or writing
            the article about it, or something to that effect, as ‚Äúa scam.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is what he wrote me:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Hi Scammer,<br>
              why are you so full of shit of claiming you wrote this piece -
              <code>https://www.gessato.com/modular-office-unit/</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Take that link down immediately fucking scumbag.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            That‚Äôs the entire email. It shocked me and <a href="/posts/scammer/">I wrote about
            it</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to explain that this is my personal website and it is obvious I did not make
            <a href="/posts/links/little-sims-no-thank-you/">the music video by Little Sims</a>, or
            record <a href="/posts/links/takako-mamiya-love-trip/">the Japanese Pop Album from
            1982</a>, or make <a href="/posts/links/gods-country-trailer/">the movie trailer for
            God‚Äôs country</a> that I linked to, <strong>just like it‚Äôs clear I didn‚Äôt make this
            furniture or write anything for gessato.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, that didn‚Äôt make things better. He replied:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              WHY??<br>
              because you are a liar. Because your web page is very deceiving and it makes users
              believe that you actually WROTE that piece.<br>
              We take pride in our content and do not tolerate people claiming ownership over
              it.<br>
              Just remove the damn link and move on.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            So, I guess just to be super extra clear to you the reader: <strong>I did not build
            this office unit, nor do I have anything to do with gessato.com</strong> which should
            be obvious, but apparently is not.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>A link from my site does not mean that I endorse the other site, that I work for or
            created the other site, or that I even know anything at all about the other site. I
            post blog posts and link posts on ‚Äúmy name dot com‚Äù, and so any content you see on ‚Äúany
            other name dot com‚Äù is obviously unrelated to me. You can even tell which posts here
            are links by the link emoji (üîó) which has been next to them for years.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The modular office unit <em>was actually</em> created by <a href=
            "https://guglielmopoletti.com/modular-office-unit/">Guglielmo Poletti</a> (who is
            obviously not me). I found it linked to by <a href=
            "https://www.swiss-miss.com/2022/12/gasp-this-modular-space.html">swiss-miss.com</a>
            which is obvisouly not my site (because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmy name dot com‚Äù). I sure hope it‚Äôs
            clear that I don‚Äôt make furniture, nor write long articles about furniture.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can read below the short sentence I originally wrote about the office unit (which
            is definitely cool looking), and judge for yourself if I‚Äôm taking credit for something
            I shouldn‚Äôt.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            I absolutely love this modular office unit! It includes a work area, tons of storage, a
            sleeping area, and even an elevated sitting area.

          <p>
            And then, I originally had linked this post to
            <code>www.gessato.com/modular-office-unit</code> so you could go there and see more
            about this office thingie. I do regret linking to them now, for sure.

            <em>I updated this on 8 Feb 2023.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>I changed the primary link to the website of Guglielmo Poletti, since he actually
            made the object in question, he has photos of if there if you want to see them, and I
            don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll send me any angry emails about my link to his site.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>I also originally linked to a desk, which was unrelated, but I‚Äôm just going to let
            this now only be about the modular office unit thing since it is such a big deal
            apparently.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And finally, I also updated my site‚Äôs design to not only put a link emoji (üîó) next
            to link posts, but now put a star emoji (‚≠êÔ∏è) next to blog posts. Maybe that will make
            it even more clear what a link is and what a blog post is. Sheesh.</em>
