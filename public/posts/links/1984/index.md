Wow, the famous Mac commercial “1984” aired 40 years ago! I was two months old 😬 I’ve seen the commercial referenced over and over throughout my life, it’s one of those cultural phenomenons. I use and love my Mac everyday, I’m glad it worked out for them 😅

40 years is both a long time, and not really that long-a-time…
