Iâ€™m **very interested** in these sustainable single use bowls and cups. I am going to have to go to [Rosa Canina](https://www.instagram.com/p/CopUsu_Mp9H/) to get some ice cream and try one out. I wonder how if it will feel stable and solid, especially with something like ice cream or coffee ðŸ¤”
