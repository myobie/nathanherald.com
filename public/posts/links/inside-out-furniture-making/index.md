I was reminded today of this furniture exhibit I saw back in 2019, and how amazingly nested the compartments were in some of the desks and cabinets. In this video they show you all the little nested areas in a piece:

It was amazing to see the pieces in real life. I recommend checking out a similar exhibit if one ever shows up near you.
