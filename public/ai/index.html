<p>AI tools and companies are progressing fast and I have a lot of
questions that I haven’t found easy answers to. <strong>So, I’ve taken
some time to research, use AI for real work, and read a lot of takes on
AI. I’m collecting what I’ve learned here.</strong> I plan to keep this
page semi-up-to-date over time as I learn more. I don’t want to make a
lot of blog posts about AI, instead I’ll just have this page here as a
living document. I’ll try to pull my “big takeaways” up here to the
top.</p>
<h2
id="big-takeaway-1-ai-is-here-and-its-best-for-me-to-understand-it">Big
Takeaway #1: AI is here and it’s best for me to understand it</h2>
<blockquote>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="315" src= "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XAPfNPIvWkM" width="560"></iframe>

<p>This stuff is probably coming for you too. Those automated phone
systems where you “hit 3 for billing” are terrible and annoying. They
are not <em>better</em> than just speaking to a human. And yet, those
are forced upon us to save costs, to reduce the number of jobs. AI seems
like that times 100: it will reduce costs so much that it will be used
whether it’s good or not.</p>
<p>And, if there are productivity gains to be had, and I think there
are, then we should own the means to run the programs that deliver them.
I’m building <a href="https://new.space/app">new.space</a> where you can
make sense of all your tabs, bookmarks, files, and notes in a private,
collaborative space using AI as you choose, you are in control. That is
one possible way to do own our data and context going forward: build
products that respect privacy and user control, letting us choose where
our data goes and when.</p>
<h2
id="big-takeaway-2-for-me-always-work-on-code-like-an-open-source-project">Big
takeaway #2 for me: Always work on code like an open source project</h2>
<p>I’ve always tried to work as close to the open source model as
possible, and now I think that is even more important. In an open
project you get suggested code changes from people you’ve never met or
heard of, their code is of dubious quality, and you have to really vet
and understand their code before accepting it into the project. Even
those you’ve added as contributors can make mistakes or their accounts
can get hacked.</p>
<p>Code originating from generative AI must be seen as a suspicious
contribution as well.</p>
<p>What’s great is we already have tools to handle this. We have pull
request reviews, CI, multi-approval requirements before merging,
sandboxes or staging environments, etc. All of these things are made to
protect us from ourselves, and they will all help protect us from AI
tools as well.</p>
<p>TK I’d love to expand on this more soon.</p>
<h2 id="big-takeaway-3-the-lethal-trifecta-for-ai-agents">Big takeaway
#3: The lethal trifecta for AI agents</h2>
<p>Simon Willison identified the three properties that, when combined in
an AI agent system, create a serious security vulnerability:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Access to private data</strong> (emails, files,
databases)</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to untrusted content</strong> (web pages, documents
from others)</li>
<li><strong>The ability to externally communicate</strong> (HTTP
requests, sending emails, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>LLMs are unable to <em>reliably distinguish</em> the importance of
instructions based on where they came from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removing any one of the three legs is enough to prevent the attack.
This is particularly relevant as people adopt <a
href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">MCP</a> plugins where mixing
tools from different sources can inadvertently assemble all three
dangerous ingredients together.</p>

<h2 id="the-internet-is-full-of-confusing-takes">The internet is full of
confusing takes</h2>
<p>Some of the smartest people I know are anti-AI and refuse to
knowingly use it. Some of the other smartest people I know are using AI
everyday, and say everyone else should too. I’ve heard some say they’ve
been “AI pilled” (both in a positive and negative way). Some say there
is no ethical way to use AI. Some say AI is mistaken so often to be
useless. Others say it’s correct so often that they don’t need as many
employees/coworkers anymore to do their work.</p>
<p>In this current moment, if someone tells you what AI can definitely
do or what it can definitely not do without a clear demo that you can
run yourself, then you can’t believe them. Companies are saying it can
do more than it probably can. Skeptics or those against AI are spreading
misinformation that it cannot do things which it can objectively do.
Both are problematic.</p>

<details>
<summary>Are all AI tools trained on stolen content?</summary>

<p>No. And this surprised me.</p>
<p>Firefly is trained only on licensed content by Adobe. This seems like
a great decision for them, especially from a quality control
perspective.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/firefly/gen-ai-approach.html">Our
approach to generative AI with Adobe Firefly</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only train Adobe Firefly on content where we have permission to do
so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phi-4-mini claims to be trained on high quality data like licensed
books and academic sources. This is a very good, tool call capable model
that can run on a laptop or phone, so this opens up a ton of local AI
use cases where you use your own energy to do AI tasks with a more
ethically trained model.</p>
<p><a href="https://ollama.com/library/phi4-mini">phi-4-mini on
Ollama</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phi-4-mini is a lightweight model built upon a blend of synthetic
datasets, data from filtered public domain websites, and acquired
academic books and Q&amp;A datasets. The goal of this approach was to
ensure that small capable models were trained with data focused on high
quality and advanced reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems very possible to build SMLs and maybe even LLMs in an
ethical way with enough effort and will.</p>
<p>However, all the “big models”, frontier LLMs, are in a grey area
today. Courts are now ruling, but in contradictory ways: the <a
href="https://www.ropesgray.com/en/insights/viewpoints/102lvxe/getty-image-loses-copyright-infringement-claim-against-stability-ai-in-uks-first">UK
High Court ruled</a> (Getty v. Stability AI, Nov 2025) that AI training
does NOT constitute copyright infringement because trained models don’t
“store” copyrighted works. Meanwhile, a <a
href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/landmark-ruling-of-the-munich-regional-court-(gema-v-openai)-on-copyright-and-ai-training">Munich
court ruled the opposite</a> (GEMA v. OpenAI, Nov 2025), finding OpenAI
violated German copyright law by training on song lyrics. In the US, the
<a
href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5288157/new-york-times-openai-copyright-case-goes-forward">NYT
v. OpenAI case</a> is progressing but hasn’t gone to trial yet. And the
music industry is <a
href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/warner-music-signs-deal-with-ai-music-startup-suno-settles-lawsuit/">settling
into licensing deals</a> rather than waiting for courts.</p>
<p>Extra-legally, it can feel like theft for sure. The vibes are mixed
and that is worth acknowledging. <strong>I don’t believe the law will
actually help us here.</strong> The egg is already scrambled and courts
across jurisdictions can’t even agree on the basics. Extra-legally,
pressure can always be applied towards companies that they behave in a
more ethical manner. Sure. We should always strive for that. We don’t
have to accept raw capitalism. We are always making trade offs, and that
will continue.</p>

<summary>Is the transformer pattern itself unethical?</summary>

<p>While I have read more than one person online trying to say it is, I
have found no reason to believe that it is.</p>
<p>Matrix transforms + a giant embedding space seems to be the main
magic here, and that’s math.</p>
<p>It helped me to learn more about what is actually going on. Checkout

<em>and</em> how we got to where we are today.</p>

<details>
<summary>Does AI break the economic model of the internet?</summary>

<p>The internet does not have one economic model. Advertising is
Google’s economic model (and then Facebook copied it as well). Saying
“advertising is the economic model of the internet” benefits Google and
Facebook, it’s the story they want told. There are other economic models
working. Those will remain. Advertising may take a pretty big hit, for
sure.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is it really a good idea to give so much data to just a few very large companies?</summary>

<p>Definitely not.</p>
<p>And this is one reason I am working hard to enable local AI workflows
on phones and laptops. I want to make it easy to bend this tech to
benefit us, not bend ourselves to benefit it. It’s more important than
ever that we are in control of our data, of our context.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Isn’t this all hype like web3?</summary>

<p>First, I hate that you made me type “web3” on this here website.</p>
<p>Second, web3 is a lot different. My coins get more valuable if you
buy a coin. It’s that simple. So I need as many people as possible to
buy coins, so I can buy low and sell high. Stable coins might have
utility, a lot of adjacent research and math is useful, IPFS is cool,
sure, but overall it really seems mostly like a way to make new
speculative assets.</p>
<p>AI is not like this at all. My AI tasks don’t start working better,
or become more valuable if you use AI too. Also, most of the big AI
companies are still losing money because of how expensive all of this is
for them, though there are exceptions – Midjourney is profitable with
zero outside funding, and Microsoft is making real money on Azure AI.
Most AI companies are “valuable” today because of future profits, not
their profits today. They have cash flowing through them, but most are
not capturing much of that cash… instead they are spending money to
watch all their revenue flow out. The chip maker is doing quite well
though, if you haven’t seen.</p>
<p>So it’s just not the same. The parts that feel the same are probably
just general hype cycle dynamics.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Isn’t this using so much water and energy that we should be concerned?</summary>

<p>Yes, probably.</p>
<p>I’ve read quite a bit about this now and the honest answer is: the
reporting doesn’t do a great job of putting things into perspective. A
single ChatGPT query uses roughly 5x more electricity than a web search,
but what does that actually mean compared to, say, the energy I use
making coffee or driving to the store? The articles I’ve found are
better at describing the scale of data center growth than at helping a
normal person understand where AI fits into their own energy
footprint.</p>
<p>That said, the trajectory is concerning. <a
href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/">MIT
Technology Review reports</a> that by 2028 more than half of data center
electricity will go to AI, and no company reports AI-specific
environmental metrics. <a
href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/ai-data-centers-and-water/">Brookings
reports</a> that a typical data center uses 300,000 gallons of water per
day for cooling, and large ones use 5 million gallons – and water
cooling demand may increase 870%.</p>
<p>The real concern isn’t today’s usage but the growth trajectory. AI
usage is expected to double or triple in the next few years, and
infrastructure decisions being made now will lock in environmental
impacts for decades. Efficiency improvements are real (newer chips,
better cooling) but are being outpaced by demand growth.</p>

<summary>What is an agent, what does that really mean?</summary>

<p>An agent is an LLM or SLM with possible tool/function calls, running
in a loop. The LM can generate a spec to call a tool, another program
calls that tool, then the previous conversation + the return value of
the tool is fed back into the LLM. Repeat. Sometimes there is a function
call to end the loop, the LM can generate the spec to call that to
finish the task.</p>
<p><strong>”Tools in a loop.”</strong></p>
<p>There are many other definitions of “agent,” but <strong>this is the
one I like best right now.</strong></p>
<p>RE this article by Simon Willison: <a
href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/tools-in-a-loop/">Tools in a
Loop</a>.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="capabilities-today">Capabilities Today</h2>
<p><em>I have found it difficult to understand what AI tools can
actually do today. So I’ve been using different AI tools in anger +
learning who to trust, who is reasonable about them. Here are some
answers to my questions about capabilities.</em></p>
<p>I have shipped code written by LLMs. Sometimes they write exactly the
code I would have written and it doesn’t need any touch ups. Other
times, they produce slop that I have to just clear and try again or
write myself. The variance is the thing – it’s not consistently good or
consistently bad, it’s both, sometimes in the same session.</p>
<details>
<summary>AI tools aren’t _really_ doing anything beyond fancy spell check, next word prediction, right?</summary>

<p>Related: <a
href="https://mastodon.cloud/@jasongorman/114595098303670564">https://mastodon.cloud/@jasongorman/114595098303670564</a></p>
<p>It is more nuanced. Next word prediction is very important for these
products, but there are a few more things going on.</p>
<p>One thing that is worth watching is <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NlrfOl0l8U">this video about
Google’s Alpha Geometry project</a> and how much “not AI” there is in
that system. You don’t need to understand all of the geometry to
understand that the AI part of the program isn’t even half of the whole
deal.</p>
<p>Another example is <a
href="https://www.uber.com/en-DE/blog/query-gpt/">QueryGPT</a>. A
specially trained LLM can generate SQL from a plain English query. Then
a normal database system will run the SQL and return the results. And,
if one wants, the return value from the database could be fed back onto
an LLM to generate a more “human friendly” response.</p>
<p>Generative AI (different types of fancy prediction) output is very
useful as an input into another system. ChatGPT debuted as just
Generative AI without much else, it would spew back text to you and that
was it. But today, all of the major AI products are a series of
workflows and pipes, where one or more of the steps is generative.</p>
<p>So, yes and no.</p>
<p>And hopefully you can start to imagine how “generating statistically
likely text / code to feed into something else” could be useful
sometimes.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are these AI tools good at/for search?</summary>

<p>Yes. Google search pretty much sucks right now.</p>
<p>AI research tools can be much better at surfacing the long tail. LLMs
themselves have nothing to do with search, but “AI tools” and “agents”
which might use LLMs to generate search queries, filters, etc can do a
better job at searching than the average person. It feels to me like we
are just beginning to see how LLMs and SLMs can help us improve our
searching.</p>

<summary>Why would I ask AI to research something for me? Won’t it just invent new things? When I ask AI to research something for me, what do I actually get?</summary>

<p>While working at Microsoft I heard a lot of <em>Bill Gates
stories.</em> 😅 And while they might just be legends, one of them I
remember and is related.</p>
<p>It was said that when Bill needed to learn about some difficult
topic, he would pay a team to setup and video record lectures on the
topic at top Universities. That team would then synthesize those
recordings into a compressed curriculum for him, deliverable in a single
binder. Then he could review that and quickly become a pseudo expert.
And what a smart idea!</p>
<p>AI research tools can assemble a single folder of compressed
information for you today and this works well. And this is a new super
power. You can do what Bill Gates did (or maybe didn’t do, but was said
to have done).</p>
<p>Giving the LLM some research input and having it generate a
distillation or summary is where things might go wrong. It could
generate nonsense, sure. Having the folder of resources is the most
important part of the final artifact, not the generated “human friendly”
summary.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can AI code as well as a human today?</summary>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In my experiments, it does as well as an average person. And I say
this confidently. I’ve worked with enough programmers that I think you
could easily hit the average with today’s tools.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, the average is a pretty low bar, so this isn’t as
exciting or damning as it might sound. Today’s AI coding tools seem
exactly like an unreliable coding intern who is in a hurry to go home.
Which I guess is an achievement for humankind. That said, every 3-6
months the quality and reliability of these tools really is increasing,
and I do expect them to keep getting better.</p>
<p>Code feels easier to accurately generate than normal language to me,
because of its limited grammar. And it can be tested to prove that it
works. So I think it’s about the loops of tools that go from generate to
test to remove, etc. Justin Searls has written that <a
href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/tdd-is-more-important-than-ever/">TDD
is more important than ever</a> precisely because AI coding agents need
verification to work well. He also <a
href="https://justin.searls.co/links/2025-09-08-i-ve-got-your-shovelware-right-here/">built
a project in three hours</a> that would have taken weeks, making it
worth doing at all.</p>
<p>There is real research now. A <a
href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/how-generative-ai-affects-highly-skilled-workers">large
RCT at Microsoft, Accenture, and a Fortune 100 company</a> (4,867
developers) found Copilot increased completed tasks by 26% – but almost
all the gains went to junior devs (27-39%), while senior devs saw only
8-13%. Meanwhile, a <a
href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">METR
study</a> of 16 experienced open-source developers found that AI users
were actually <strong>19% slower</strong> on their own repos – and the
developers <em>believed</em> they were 20% faster. That
perception-reality gap is worth sitting with.</p>

<p>The most successful projects I’ve worked on have been where I was
fixing some awful, existing code. So if you enjoy fixing broken
projects, this is your heyday.</p>

<summary>Can AI _design_, like posters, graphics, art today?</summary>

<p>This needs to be split into two answers now.</p>
<p><strong>Reproducing something visually, pixel for pixel: mostly
no.</strong> Posters and graphic design are not code or bitmap images.
You can generate bitmap images using AI tools, but that is not quite the
same as “design.” <a
href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">Simon
Willison always has each new model generate a pelican riding a bicycle
and the results are informative.</a></p>
<p><strong>Creating designs and working apps just by prompting: very
much yes.</strong> <a
href="https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/figma-make-review/">Figma
Make</a> can turn text prompts into working app prototypes and designs,
inheriting your existing design system, with no coding required. If you
want a website or app prototype that is as good as the average, then
yeah, you can get that from a prompt today.</p>
<p><strong>And you can now generate 3D models from text
prompts.</strong> Tools like <a href="https://www.meshy.ai/">Meshy</a>,
<a href="https://www.tripo3d.ai/">Tripo AI</a>, and Luma Genie can
generate textured, export-ready 3D meshes in 30-60 seconds from a
description. These cover modeling, texturing, retopology, and rigging.

<p>Mitchell Hashimoto (co-founder of HashiCorp) wrote <a
href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey">My AI
Adoption Journey</a> documenting his six-phase path from skepticism to
running agents continuously. The whole thing is worth reading, but some
highlights: he forced himself to do every task twice (once manually,
then with an agent) to build real intuition. He dedicates the last 30
minutes of each workday to agent tasks. And he invests heavily in
“harness engineering” – building verification tools and documentation
(<code>AGENTS.md</code>) that help agents self-correct. He also wrote
about <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/non-trivial-vibing">vibing
a non-trivial Ghostty feature</a> – 16 AI sessions, $15.98 in tokens,
and about 8 hours across 3 days to ship a real feature. His core
takeaway: “Good AI drivers are experts in their domains and utilize AI
as an assistant, not a replacement.”</p>
<h2 id="openclaw">OpenClaw</h2>
<p><a href="https://openclaw.ai/">OpenClaw</a> (<a
href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw">github</a>) is an
open-source, self-hosted personal AI agent built by <a
href="https://steipete.me/">Peter Steinberger</a> (steipete, founder of
PSPDFKit). It’s an AI that doesn’t just chat but actually performs
tasks: messaging via WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack, browser control, device
automation, voice mode, and an extensible skills/plugin system. It runs
on your own hardware.</p>
<p>The project has had quite the naming saga: it started as
<strong>Clawdis</strong> (<a
href="https://github.com/steipete/clawdis">github</a>, Nov 2025), became
<strong>Clawdbot</strong> after growing to ~30k stars, then was renamed
to <strong>Moltbot</strong> after Anthropic’s legal team contacted
steipete about the name being too similar to “Claude” – at which point
handle snipers grabbed the old social media accounts within seconds and
crypto scammers launched a fake $CLAWD token. It finally landed on
<strong>OpenClaw</strong> (Jan 2026) and now has 179k+ GitHub stars.</p>
<p>This project currently has all three legs of the <a
href="#big-takeaway-3-the-lethal-trifecta-for-ai-agents">lethal
trifecta</a>: access to private data, exposure to untrusted content, and
the ability to externally communicate. Worth keeping in mind.</p>

<details>
<summary>Will we even know if the remote coworkers we are chatting with are human or AI?</summary>

<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>And yeah, that is dystopian. I am not excited about this, but if
current trends hold I don’t see how you can be 100% sure.</p>

<details>
<summary>So, I won’t be writing copy / writing code in the future?</summary>

<p>I don’t think this is actually the right question. Many programmers
move into roles where they write less code and spend almost all their
time reviewing code. This is natural over time. And this could happen
with AI: code review instead of code gen for code experts. Copy editors
are the same: they are good at editing, someone else generates the
copy.</p>
<p>Also, photograph didn’t kill 100% of painting, but it definitely made
painting an extra special, rare thing. You can always keep painting, but
it might not be the dominant job anymore.</p>

<details>
<summary>Will my research, coding, writing, etc skills atrophy if I use AI?</summary>

<p>Seems likely.</p>
<p>It seems to me, if you are an expert, then you are less likely to
atrophy. If you are not an expert yet, and you don’t put in the effort,
then you are not building any “muscle.” This is true today: if another
human does the hard work for you, then you didn’t learn anything. And so
that seems likely to be true with AI.</p>
<p>There is now real research on this. An <a
href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills">Anthropic
study</a> (Jan 2026) had 52 junior engineers complete coding tasks with
and without AI. The AI group scored <strong>50% on a comprehension
quiz</strong> vs <strong>67% for the hand-coding group</strong> – about
two letter grades lower. Debugging skills were hit hardest. And the time
savings from using AI were not even statistically significant. As they
put it: “AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a <a
href="https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/publications/canaries-in-the-coal-mine/">Stanford
study</a> found that employment for software devs aged 22-25 has
declined nearly 20% from its peak in late 2022. If juniors are being
hired less, the pipeline for developing senior talent narrows.</p>
<p>Related: <a
href="https://desunit.com/blog/in-the-long-run-llms-make-us-dumber/">In
the Long Run, LLMs Make Us Dumber</a> argues that over-reliance on LLMs
weakens cognitive abilities by removing beneficial mental friction.</p>
<p>If you are going to use AI, your best bet is probably to ask the AI
to help you become an expert, and not to just give you the answers.</p>

<summary>So, every product is going to have AI in it?</summary>

<p>Not every product.</p>
<p>Checkout <a
href="https://procreate.com/ai">https://procreate.com/ai</a>, for
example. My prediction is there will be a few apps that either
intentionally stay out of AI, or AI just never is a good fit for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some people are frustrated that AI is being added to
products they don’t want it in. <a
href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/115176228086016550">One person is
considering blocking all browsers except Chrome</a> because it’s the
only major browser without built-in AI summarization.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>So, every person is going to be use AI everyday?</summary>

<p>No, not everyone.</p>
<p>There definitely will be “AI vegans” and with diverse views about why
they are avoiding AI, just like there are diverse views about avoiding
meat.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Couldn’t we just turn off all the servers and be done with all of this AI stuff?</summary>

<p>No.</p>
<p>There are very capable open source models, so you’d have to delete
code permanently from the universe, and we know that is impossible.</p>
<p>I mean, sure, every government could outlaw AI and the open source
models go underground. But this feels like a fantasy to me, and not
really worth considering further.</p>

<summary>Won’t it feel not great to manage a bunch of robots, all of whom are bad in weirdly different ways at their jobs?</summary>

<p>Yes, it will not feel great for some people.</p>
<p>I am personally not excited to become a robot engineering manager…
and it definitely feels to me that that will be a job. I think the main
unknown is to what degree things will change. Will there be a few people
that change over to manage robots, or will the majority of knowledge
workers change over? If I had to guess today, I’d guess majority.</p>

<p>The thing that keeps coming up as I talk to people about AI in their
workplaces is how <em>dehumanizing</em> it is. It’s dehumanizing to ask
a machine to do something, and then have to correct it over and over;
it’s dehumanizing to be told to read something that involved little to
no human effort to make.</p>

<p>Justin Searls wrote about <a
href="https://justin.searls.co/mails/2025-09/">The Generative Creativity
Spectrum</a>: when creativity’s value is internal (writing essays for
yourself), AI diminishes it. When it’s external (producing output for
others), AI can help. Programming sits uncomfortably in the middle – AI
dramatically increases productivity but diminishes the engaging
problem-solving that made coding rewarding.</p>
<p>And steipete wrote about the flip side: AI can be <a

“Just one more prompt” mirrors unsustainable work patterns. AI restored

<summary>The robots are faster than me now and I am the bottleneck</summary>

<p>AI agents can generate code and features so quickly that I may not
have time to actually try them out. I have a side project right now
where there is something waiting for me to test, to actually sit down
and use it, and I haven’t had time. The code was generated faster than I
can evaluate it. I am the bottleneck.</p>
<p>This is a weird inversion. The hard part used to be writing the code.
Now the hard part might be having enough hours in the day to verify,
test, and actually experience what was built.</p>
